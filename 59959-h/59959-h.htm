<p class='c006'>I accept the early demand for a new edition of my
book, not so much as proof of the value of my individual
work, as of the increased interest which is being
taken in this too much neglected subject. In deference
to the wholesome advice of many reviewers, both in
the London and Provincial press, especially that of
the ‘Times’ and the ‘Athenæum,’ I have re-arranged
the whole of the chapters on ‘Patronymics’ and
‘Nicknames,’ subdividing the same under convenient
heads. By so doing the names which bear any particular
relationship to one another will be found
more closely allied than they were under their former
more general treatment.</p>
<p class='c007'>My book has met with much criticism, partly
favourable, partly adverse, from different quarters. To
my reviewers in general I offer my best thanks for their
comments. The ‘Saturday Review’—and I say it the
more readily as they will see that I have not been insensible
to the value of their criticism—has not, I think,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>sufficiently understood the nature of my work. I am well
aware that praise is due to them for having for some
length of time strenuously advocated the claim of our
language to be English through all its varying stages.
I do not see that in the general character of my book
I have lost sight of this fact. An ‘English Directory’ is
not an ‘English Dictionary.’ The influences that have
been at work on our language are not the same as
those upon our nomenclature. Every social casualty
had an effect upon our names which it could not have
upon our words. The names found in Domesday
Book, casting aside the new importation, were, in the
great majority of cases, obsolete by the end of the
twelfth century, and of those which have survived and
descended to us as surnames, well-nigh all are devoid
of diminutive or patronymic desinences—a clear proof
that they were utterly out of fashion as personal names
during the era of surname formation. The Norman
invasion was not a conquest of our language, but it
was of our nomenclature. The ‘Saturday Review’
may still demand that we shall view all as English,
and obliterate the distinctive terms of Saxon and
Norman, but in doing so let us not forget facts. The
language which preceded the Norman Conquest is still
the <i>vehicle</i> of ordinary converse. The nomenclature
of that period went down like Pharaoh’s chariot, and
like Pharaoh’s chariot, which for all I know lies where
it did, was never recovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>A review in the ‘Guardian’ demands a brief notice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>on account of the mischief it may do. The end kept
in view by the reviewer is as transparent as his inability
to reach it. Surely the day is past for any
further attempt to make out that we have no <i>metronymic</i>
surnames. The writer is evidently unaware
of the fact that the use of ‘ie’ and ‘y,’ as in ‘Teddy’
or ‘Johnnie,’ in the nineteenth century, does not prevail
to as great an extent as that of ‘ot’ and ‘et’ from
the twelfth to the fifteenth. As ‘Philip’ became
‘Philipot,’ now ‘Philpott’; as ‘William,’ ‘Williamot,’
now ‘Wilmott’; as ‘Hew’ (or Hugh), ‘Hewet’ and
‘Hewetson’; as ‘Ellis’ (or Elias), ‘Elliot’ and ‘Elliotson’;
so ‘Till’ (Matilda) became ‘Tillot’ and ‘Tillotson’;
‘Emme’ (Emma), ‘Emmott,’ ‘Emmett,’ and
‘Emmotson’; ‘Ibbe’ (Isabella), ‘Ibbott,’ ‘Ibbett,’
and ‘Ibbotson’; ‘Mary,’ ‘Mariot’ and ‘Marriott’;
and ‘Siss’ (Cecilia), ‘Sissot’ and ‘Sissotson.’ ‘Emmot,’
the writer says, is a form of ‘Amyas,’ I suppose
because he saw ‘Amyot’ in Miss Yonge’s glossary.
According to him, therefore, Emmot is a masculine
name. How comes it to pass, then, that Emmot is
<i>always</i> Latinised as Emmota, or that in our old
marriage licences ‘Richard de Akerode’ gets a dispensation
to marry ‘Emmotte de Greenwood’ (Test.
Ebor. iii. 317), or ‘Roger Prestwick’ to marry
‘Emmote Crossley’ (ditto, 338)? How is it we meet
with such entries as ‘Cissot<i>a</i> West,’ (Index) or
‘Syssot that was <i>wife</i> of Patrick’ (69)? How
is it again that Mariot is registered as ‘Mariot<i>a</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>in le Lane,’ or ‘John fil. Mariot<i>æ</i>,’ and Ibbot or
Ibbet as ‘Ibbot<i>a</i> fil. Adæ,’ or ‘Robert fil. Ibot<i>æ</i>,’
(Index)? The fact is, we have a large class of
metronymics many of which doubtless arose from
posthumous birth, or from adoption, or the more
important character of the mother in the eyes of
the neighbours than the father, others too from
illegitimacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amongst other errors for which I have been called
to account, the oddest is that of attributing to Miss
Muloch the authorship of Miss Yonge’s most useful
and laborious work on Christian names. I do not know
to which lady I owe the deepest apology—whether to
Miss Yonge for robbing her literary crown of one of
its brightest jewels, or to Miss Muloch for appearing
to insinuate that hers was incomplete. This and
several other mistakes of less moment I have rectified
in the present edition.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have to thank the authoress of ‘Mistress Margery,’
etc., for the names in the index marked QQ.,
RR. 1, RR. 2, and RR. 3. Such entries from the
registry of St. James’s, Piccadilly (QQ.), as ‘Repentance
Tompson’ (1688), ‘Loving Bell’ (1693),
‘Nazareth Rudde’ (1695), ‘Obedience Clerk’ (1697),
or ‘Unity Thornton’ (1703), may be set beside the
instances recorded on pp. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>–<a href='#Page_104'>104</a>. To these I would
take this opportunity of adding ‘Comfort Starre,’
‘Hopestill Foster,’ ‘Love Brewster,’ ‘Fear Brewster,’
‘Patience Brewster,’ ‘Remembrance Tibbott,’ ‘Remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>Allerton,’ ‘Desire Minter,’ ‘Original Lewis,’
and ‘Thankes Sheppard,’ all being names of emigrants
from England in the 17th century. (<i>Vide</i>
Hotten’s ‘Original Lists of Persons of Quality.’)</p>

<p class='c006'>As prefaces are very little read, I will make this
as brief as possible. It is strange how little has
been written upon the sources and significations of our
English surnames. Of books of Peerage, of Baronetage,
and of Landed Gentry, thanks to Sir Bernard
Burke, Mr. Walford, and others, we are not without a
sufficiency; but of books purporting to treat of the
ordinary surnames that greet our eye as we scan our
shop-fronts, or look down a list of contributions, or
glance over the ‘hatches, matches, and despatches’
of our newspapers—of these there are but few.
Indeed, putting aside Mr. Lower’s able and laborious
researches, we may say none. Tracts, pamphlets,
short treatises, articles in magazines, have at various
times appeared, but they have been necessarily confined
and limited in their treatment of the subject.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>And yet what can be more natural than that we
should desire to know something relating to the
origin of our surname, when it arose, who first got it,
and how? Of the feebleness of my own attempt to
solve all this I am conscious that I need not to be
reminded. Still, I think the ordinary reader will find
in a perusal of this book some slight increase of information,
and if not this, that he has whiled away, not
unpleasantly, some of his less busy hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the last seven years I have devoted the
whole of my spare time to the preparation of a
‘Dictionary of English Surnames.’ But about two
years ago it struck me that perhaps a smaller work
dealing with the subject in a less formal and more
familiar style might not be unacceptable to many, as
a kind of rudimentary treatise. In the course of my
labours I have come under obligations to several
writers and several Societies. To long-departed men,
whose works do follow after them, I must give a
passing allusion. Camden was the first to draw
attention to this subject, and though he wrote little,
and that little not of the most correct kind, still he
has afforded the groundwork for all future students.
Verstegan, who came next with his ‘Restitution of
Decayed Intelligence,’ wrote quaintly, amusingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>and incorrectly; and, with respect to surnames, his
definitions rather teach what they do not than what
they do mean. Passing over several archæological
papers, and with a wide gap in regard to time, we
come to Mr. Lower’s studies. He was the first to
give a real compendium of English nomenclature.
Of his earlier efforts I will say nothing, for the
‘Patronymica Britannica’ is that upon which his
fame must rest. The fault of that work is that the
author has confined his researches all but entirely to
the Hundred Rolls. These Rolls are undoubtedly
the best for such reference; but there are many
others, as my index will show, which not merely contain
a large mass of examples not to be met with
there, but which, by varieties of spelling in the case of
such names as they share in common with the other,
afford comparisons the use of which would have
made him certain where he has only guessed, and
would have enabled him also to avoid many false
conclusions. This I would say with all respect, as
one who has benefited very considerably by Mr.
Lower’s labours. Others I must thank more briefly,
though none the less heartily. To Mr. Halliwell I
am under deep obligation, for to his ‘Dictionary of
Archaisms’ I have gone freely by way of quotation.
To Mr. Way’s notes to his valuable edition of the
‘Promptorium Parvulorum’ I am also indebted for
much interesting information regarding mediæval life
and its surroundings. Miss Yonge’s ‘History of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>Christian Names’ contains a large store of help to
students of this kind of lore, and of this I have
availed myself in several instances. In conclusion, I
have to acknowledge much valuable aid received from
the publications of the Surtees Society, the Early
English Text Society, the Camden Society, and the
Chetham Society. It is in the rooms belonging to the
latter that I have had the opportunity of consulting
most of the records and archives, a list of which
prefaces my index, as well as other books of a more
incidentally helpful character, and I cannot allow
this opportunity to pass without tendering my hearty
thanks to Thomas Jones, Esq., B.A., F.S.A., for his
courtesy in permitting me access to all parts of the
library, and to Mr. Richard Hanby, the under-librarian,
for his constant attention and readiness to
supply me with whatever books I required.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE<br /> <br /><span class='small'>TO THE</span><br /> <br />INDEX OF INSTANCES.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>There are several matters which I deem it
advisable to mention to the reader before
he turns his attention to the Index of Instances
(pp. <a href='#Page_514'>514</a>–<a href='#Page_612'>612</a>).</p>
<p class='c007'>I. I have not, in the various chapters that form the
body of this book, in all cases drawn particular attention
when any name happens to belong to several
distinct classes. In the Index, however, I have tried to
remedy this by furnishing instances under the several
heads to which they have been assigned in the text.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. While ordinarily adhering to my plan of giving
but two examples, I have set down three in some
instances that seemed more interesting, and in exceptional
cases even four. To the majority of the
appended surnames more illustrations of course could
have been added had it been expedient or necessary.
There are several names, however, which, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>evidently of familiar occurrence in early days, as they
are now, are yet, so far as my own researches go,
without any record. For instance, I cannot find any
Arkwright or Runchiman previous to the sixteenth
century. The origin is perfectly clear, but the
registry is wanting. Of several others, again, I can
light upon but one entry. Still, in a matter like this
one must be thankful for small mercies, and it was
with no small amount of rejoicing that in such a
simple record as that of ‘John Sykelsmith’ I found
the progenitor, or one of the progenitors, of our many
‘Sucksmiths,’ ‘Sixsmiths,’ ‘Shuxsmiths,’ etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. There has been a difficulty with regard to
Christian names also, which I have not attempted to
overcome because it was impossible to do so. With
the Normans every baptismal name, masculine or
feminine as it might originally be, was the common
property of the sexes. Thus by simply appending
the feminine desinence, ‘Druett’ became ‘Druetta’
(<i>v.</i> Drewett), ‘Williamet’ became ‘Williametta’ (<i>v.</i>
Williamot), ‘Aylbred’ became ‘Aylbreda’ (<i>v.</i> Allbright),
‘Raulin’ became ‘Raulina’ (<i>v.</i> Rawlings), and
‘Goscelin’ became ‘Goscelina’ (<i>v.</i> Gosling). Any of
these surnames, Drewett, Willmott, Allbright, Rawlings,
or Gosling, therefore, may be of feminine origin—nay,
if the reader has studied my chapter on ‘Patronymic
Surnames’ with any care, he will see that this is
fully as probable as the opposite view. Leaving thus
undecided what cannot be solved, I have placed both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>masculine and feminine forms under the one surname
to which one or other has given rise.</p>

<p class='c007'>IV. There has been another difficulty also in respect
of Christian names. These, as has been shown
in the chapter thereupon, were turned into pet forms,
and these shortened forms commonly came to be the
foundation of the surname. In all the more formal
registers, however, these surnames were never so set
down. ‘Hugh Thomasson,’ ‘William Thompson,’
and ‘Henry Tomson’ might come to have their
names enrolled, and up to the beginning of the sixteenth
century at least they would be set down alike
as ‘Hugh fil. Thomas,’ ‘William fil. Thomas,’ and
‘Henry fil. Thomas.’ Thus, again, ‘Ralph Higginson’
or ‘John Higgins’ would be ‘Radulphus’ or
‘Johannes fil. Isaac.’ This has prevented me from
giving so many instances of these curter forms
of the patronymic class as I should have liked. When
they are given, the reader will observe that they
come from less punctilious and more irregular sources,
such as for instance the Surtees’ Society’s collection
of Mediæval Yorkshire Wills and Inventories. Where
I have given such an instance as ‘Elekyn’ (<i>v.</i>
Elkins) by itself, it must be understood that this is
the Christian name, and that the owner when his or
her name was registered did not boast a surname
at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>V. By way of interesting the reader I have occasionally
given the Latin form of entry. Thus ‘Adam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>the Goldsmith’ is set down as ‘Adam Aurifaber’
(<i>v.</i> Aurifaber), ‘Henry the Butcher’ as ‘Henry Carnifex’
(<i>v.</i> Carnifex), and ‘Hugh the Tailor’ as ‘Hugh
Cissor’ (<i>v.</i> Cissor). Latin, indeed, seems to have
been the vehicle of ordinary indenture. Thus under
‘Littlejohn’ the reader will find extracted from the
Hundred Rolls ‘Ricardus fil. Parvi-Johannis,’ and
under ‘Linota,’ ‘Linota Vidua,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘Linota the Widow.’
In the recording of local names, Norman-French and
Saxon seem to have fought for the first place, and
even in our most formal registers they had the precedence
over Latin. Thus if the latter can boast the
entry of ‘Isolda Beauchamp’ as ‘Isolda de Bello
Campo’ (<i>v.</i> Beauchamp), still, if we come to such
generic names as Briggs or Brook, we find the entry
is all but invariably either ‘Henry Atte-brigg’ or
‘Roger del Brigge’ (<i>v.</i> Briggs), or ‘Alice de la Broke
or ‘Ada ate Brok’ (<i>v.</i> Brook). As respects nicknames
or names of occupation, the Norman-French
tongue had them to itself. ‘Roger le Buck,’ ‘Philip
le Criour,’ ‘Thomas le Cuchold,’ ‘Osbert le Curteys,’
or ‘Thomas le Cupper’—such is their continuous form
of entry. Such a Saxon enrolment as ‘Robert the
Brochere’ (<i>v.</i> Broker) is of the rarest occurrence—so
rare, indeed, as to make one feel it was an undoubted
freak on the part of the registrar, whoever he might be.</p>

<p class='c007'>VI. In some few cases I have set down surnames
which are not treated of in the text. I have done
this either because the name seemed worthy of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>casual notice, or because, though not itself mentioned,
it happened to corroborate some statement I have
made regarding a particular name belonging to the
same class.</p>

<p class='c007'>In conclusion, I will not say there is no mistake
in the Index—that would be a bold thing to state;
I will not say that I may not have given an instance
that does not rightly belong to the surname under
which it is set; but I can asseverate that I have
honestly attempted to be correct, and I believe a
careful examination will find but the most occasional
error, if any at all, of this class.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>To review the sources of a people’s nomenclature is
to review that people’s history. When we remember
that there is nothing without a name, and that
every name that is named, whether it be of a man, or
man’s work, or man’s heritage of earth, came not by
chance, or accident so called, but was given out of
some nation’s spoken language to denote some characteristic
that language expressed, we can readily
imagine how important is the drift of each—what a
record must each contain. We cannot but see that
could we only grasp their true meaning, could we but
take away the doubtful crust in which they are oftentimes
imbedded, then should we be speaking out of the
very mouth of history itself. For names are enduring—generations
come and go; and passing on with
each, they become all but everlasting. Nomenclature,
in fact, is a well in which, as the fresh water is flowing
perennially through, there is left a sediment that
clings to the bottom. This silty deposit may accumulate—nay,
it may threaten to choke it up, still the
well is there. It but requires to be exhumed, and we
shall behold it in all its simple proportions once more.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>And thus it is with names. They betoken life and
matter that is ever coming and going, ever undergoing
change and decay. But through it all they
abide. The accretions of passing years may fasten
upon them—the varied accidents of lapsing time may
attach to them—they may become all but undistinguishable,
but only let us get rid of that which cleaves
to them, and we lay bare in all its naked simplicity
the character and the lineaments of a long gone era.
Look for instance at our place-names. Apart from
their various corruptions they are as they were first
entitled. So far as the nomenclature of our country
itself is concerned, England is at this present day as
rude, as untutored, and as heathen as at the moment
those Norwegian and Germanic hordes grounded their
keels upon our shores, for all our place-names, saving
where the Celt still lingers, are their bequest, and
bear upon them the impress of their life and its surroundings.
These are they which tell us such strange
truths—how far they had made progress as yet in the
arts of life, what were the habits they practised, what
was the religion they believed in. And as with place-names,
so with our own. As records of past history
they are equally truthful, equally suggestive. One
important difference, however, there is—Place-names,
as I have just hinted, once given are all but imperishable.
Mountains, valleys, and streams still, as a rule,
retain the names first given them. Personal names,
those simple individual names which we find in use
throughout all pre-Norman history, were but for the
life of him to whom they were attached. They died
with him, nor passed on saving accidentally. Nor
were those second designations, those which we call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>surnames as being ‘superadded to Christian names,’
at first of any lasting character. It was not till the
eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, or even fourteenth centuries
that they became hereditary—that is, in any true
sense stationary.</p>
<p class='c007'>Before, however, we enter into the history of these,
and with regard to England that is the purpose of
this book, it will be well to take a brief survey of the
actual state of human nomenclature in preceding
times. Surnames, we must remember, were the simple
result of necessity when population, hitherto isolated
and small, became so increased as to necessitate
further particularity than the merely personal one
could supply. One name, therefore, was all that was
needed in early times, and one name, as a general
rule, is all that we find. The Bible is, of course, our
first record of these—‘Adam,’ ‘Eve,’ ‘Joseph,’ ‘Barak,’
‘David,’ ‘Isaiah,’ all were simple, single, and expressive
titles, given in most cases from some circumstances
attending their creation or birth. When the
Israelites were crowded together in the wilderness
they were at once involved in difficulties of identification.
We cannot imagine to ourselves how such a
population as that of Manchester or Birmingham could
possibly get on with but single appellations. Of course
I do not put this by way of real comparison, for with
the Jewish clan or family system this difficulty must
have been materially overcome. Still it is no wonder
that in the later books of Moses we should find them
falling back upon this patronymic as a means of
identifying the individual. Thus such expressions
as ‘Joshua the son of Nun,’ or ‘Caleb the son of
Jephunah,’ or ‘Jair the son of Manasseh,’ are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>unfrequently to be met with. Later on, this necessity
was caused by a further circumstance. Certain of
these single names became popular over others.
‘John,’ ‘Simon,’ and ‘Judas’ were such. A further
distinction, therefore, was necessary. This gave rise
to sobriquets of a more diverse character. We find
the <i>patronymic</i> still in use, as in ‘Simon Barjonas,’
that is, ‘Simon the son of Jonas;’ but in addition to
this, we have also the <i>local</i> element introduced, as in
‘Simon of Cyrene,’ and the <i>descriptive</i> in ‘Simon the
Zealot.’ Thus, again, we have ‘Judas Iscariot,’ whatever
that may mean, for commentators are divided
upon the subject; ‘Judas Barsabas,’ and ‘Judas of
Galilee.’ In the meantime the heathen but polished
nations of Greece and Rome had been adopting
similar means, though the latter was decidedly the
first in method. Among the former, such double
names as ‘Dionysius the Tyrant,’ ‘Diogenes the
Cynic,’ ‘Socrates the son of Sophronicus,’ or ‘Hecatæus
of Miletus,’ show the same custom, and the same
need. To the Roman, however, belongs, as I have
said, the earliest system of nomenclature, a system,
perhaps, more careful and precise than any which has
followed after. The purely Roman citizen had a
threefold name. The first denoted the ‘<i>prænomen</i>,’
and answered to our personal, or baptismal, name.
The second was what we may term the <i>clan-name</i>;
and the third, the cognomen, corresponded with our
present <i>surname</i>. Thus we have such treble appellations
as ‘Marcus Tullius Cicero,’ or ‘Aulus Licinius
Archeas.’ If a manumitted slave had the citizenship
conferred upon him, his single name became his cognomen,
and the others preceded it, one generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>being the name of him who was the emancipator.
Thus was it of ‘Licinius’ in the last-mentioned instance.
With the overthrow of the Western Empire,
however, this system was lost, and the barbarians who
settled upon its ruins brought back the simple appellative
once more. Arminius, their chief hero, was
content with that simple title. Alaric, the brave
King of the Goths, is only so known. Caractacus
and Vortigern, to come nearer home, represented but
the same custom.</p>

<p class='c007'>But we are not without traces of those descriptive
epithets which had obtained among the earlier communities
of the East. The Venerable Bede, speaking
of two missionaries, both of whom bore the name of
‘Hewald,’ says, ‘pro diversâ capellorum specie unus
Niger Hewald, alter Albus diceretur;’ that is, in
modern parlance, the colour of their hair being
different, they came to be called ‘Hewald Black,’ and
‘Hewald White.’ Another Saxon, distinguished for
his somewhat huge proportions, and bearing the name
of ‘Ethelred,’ was known as ‘Mucel,’ or ‘Great,’ a
word still lingering in the Scottish <i>mickle</i>. We may
class him, therefore, with our ‘le Grands,’ as we
find them inscribed in the Norman rolls, the progenitors
of our ‘Grants,’ and ‘Grands,’ or our ‘Biggs,’
as Saxon as himself. Thus again, our later ‘Fairfaxes,’
‘Lightfoots,’ ‘Heavisides,’ and ‘Slows,’ are
but <i>hereditary</i> nicknames like to the earlier ‘Harfagres,’
‘Harefoots,’ ‘Ironsides,’ and ‘Unreadys,’
which died out, so far as their immediate possessors
went, with the ‘Harolds,’ and ‘Edmunds,’ and
‘Ethelreds,’ upon whom they were severally foisted.
They were but expressions of popular feeling to individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>persons by means of which that individuality
was increased, and, as with every other instance I have
mentioned hitherto, passed away with the lives of
their owners. No descendant succeeded to the title.
The son, in due course of time, got a sobriquet of his
own, by which he was familiarly known, but that, too,
was but personal and temporary. It was no more
hereditary than had been his father’s before him, and
even so far as himself was concerned might be again
changed according to the humour or caprice of his
neighbours and acquaintances. And this went on for
several more centuries, only as population increased
these sobriquets became but more and more
common.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, however, a
change took place. By a silent and unpremeditated
movement over the whole of the more populated and
civilized European societies, nomenclature began to
assume a solid lasting basis. It was the result, in
fact, of an insensibly growing necessity. Population
was on the increase, commerce was spreading, and
society was fast becoming corporate. With all this
arose difficulties of individualization. It was impossible,
without some further distinction, to maintain a
current identity. Hence what had been but an occasional
and irregular custom became a fixed and
general practice—the distinguishing sobriquet, not, as
I say, of premeditation, but by a silent compact, became
part and parcel of a man’s property, and passed
on with his other possessions to his direct descendants.
This sobriquet had come to be of various kinds. It
might be the designation of the property owned, as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the case of the Norman barons and their feudatory
settlements, or it might be some local peculiarity that
marked the abode. It might be the designation of
the craft the owner followed. It might be the title of
the rank or office he held. It might be a patronymic—a
name acquired from the personal or Christian name
of his father or mother. It might be some characteristic,
mental or physical, complimentary or the reverse.
Any of these it might be, it mattered not
which; but when once it became attached to the possessor
and gave him a fixed identity, it clung to him
for his life, and eventually passed on to his offspring.
Then it was that at length local and personal names
came somewhat upon the same level; and as the
former, some centuries before, had stereotyped the life
of our various Celtic and Slavonic and Teutonic settlements,
so now these latter fossilized the character of
the era in which they arose; and here we have them,
with all the antiquity of their birth upon them,
breathing of times and customs and fashions and
things that are now wholly passed from our eyes, or
are so completely changed as to bear but the faintest
resemblance to that which they have been. To
analyse some of these names, for all were impossible,
is the purpose of the following chapters. I trust that
ere I have finished my task, I shall have been able to
throw some little light, at least, on the life and habits
of our early English forefathers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader will have observed that I have just
incidentally alluded to five different classes of names.
For the sake of further distinction I will place them
formally and under more concise headings:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>

      <div class='line'>5. Sobriquet surnames, or Nicknames.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>I need scarcely add that under one of these five
divisions will every surname in all the countries of
Europe be found.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>It is impossible to say how important an influence
have merely personal names exercised upon our
nomenclature. The most familiar surnames we can
meet with, saving that of ‘Smith,’ are to be found in
this list. For frequency we have no names to be compared
with ‘Jones,’ or ‘Williamson,’ or ‘Thompson,’
or ‘Richardson.’ How they came into being is easily
manifest. Nothing could be more natural than that
children should often pass current in the community
in which they lived as the sons of ‘Thomas,’ or
‘William,’ or ‘Richard,’ or ‘John;’ and that these
several relationships should be found in our directories
as distinct sobriquets only shows that there was a
particular generation in these families in which this
title became permanent, and passed on to future
descendants as an hereditary surname.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c009'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The interest
that attaches to these patronymics is great—for it is
by them we can best discover what names were in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>vogue at this period, and what not, and of those which
were, by their relative frequency, in a measure, what
were the most popular. Certainly the change is most
extraordinary when we compare the past with the
present. Some, once so popular that they scarce gave
identity to the bearer, are now all but obsolete, while
numerous appellations at present generally current
were then utterly unknown. There are surnames
familiar to our ears whose root as a Christian name is
now passed out of knowledge; while, on the other
hand, many a Christian name now daily upon our
lips has no surname formed from it to tell of any
lengthened existence. The fact is, that while our surnames,
putting immigration aside, have been long at a
standstill, we have ever been and are still adding to
our stock of baptismal names.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c009'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Each new national
crisis, each fresh achievement of our arms, each new
princely bride imported from abroad—these events
are being commemorated daily at the font. This is
but the continuance of a custom, and one very natural,
which has ever existed. Turn where we will in
English history during the last eight hundred years,
and we shall find the popular sympathies seeking an
outlet in baptism. Did a prince of the blood royal
meet with a hapless and cruel fate? His memory was
at once embalmed in the names of the children born
immediately afterwards, saving when a mother’s superstitious
fears came in to prevent it. Did some national
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>hero arise who upheld and asserted the people’s rights
against a grinding and hateful tyranny? His name
is speedily to be found inscribed on every hearth.
The reverse is of equal significance. It is by the fact
of a name, which must have been of familiar import,
finding few to represent it, we can trace a people’s
dislikes and a nation’s prejudices. A name once in
favour, as a rule, however, kept its place. The cause
to which it owed its rise had long passed into the
shade of forgotten things, but the name, if it had
but attained a certain hold, seems easily to have
kept it, till indeed such a convulsion occurred
as revolutionised men and things and their names
together.</p>

<p class='c007'>There have been two such revolutionary crises in
English nomenclature, the Conquest and the Reformation,
the second culminating in the Puritan Commonwealth.
Other crises have stamped themselves in
indelible lines upon our registers, but the indenture,
if as strongly impressed, was far less general, and
in the main merely enlarged rather than changed
our stock of national names. Thus was it with the
Crusades. A few of the names it introduced have
been popular ever since. Many, at first received
favourably, died out, if not with, at least soon after,
the subsidence of the spirit to which they owed their
rise. Some of these came from the Eastern Church,
of whose existence at all the Crusader seems to have
suddenly reminded us. Some were Biblical, associated
in Bible narrative with the very soil the Templars
trod. Some, again, were borrowed from Continental
comrades in arms, names which had caught the fancy
of those who introduced them, or were connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>with friendly rivalries and pledged friendships. This
era, being concurrent with the establishment of surnames,
has left its mark upon our nomenclature; but
it was no revolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>The period in which these names began to assume
an hereditary character varies so greatly that it is
impossible to make any definite statement. As a
familiar custom I should say it arose in the twelfth
century. But there are places, both in Lancashire
and Yorkshire, where, as in Wales, men are wont to
be styled to this very day by a complete string of
patronymics. To hear a man called ‘Bill’s o’Jack’s,’
‘o’Dick’s,’ ‘o’Harry’s,’ ‘o’Tom’s,’ is by no means a
rare incident. A hit at this formerly common Welsh
practice is given in ‘Sir John Oldcastle,’ a play
printed in 1600, in which ran the following conversation:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Judge: What bail? What sureties?</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Davy: Her cozen ap Rice, ap Evan, ap Morice,
ap Morgan, ap Llewellyn, ap Madoc, ap Meredith, ap
Griffin, ap Davis, ap Owen, ap Shinkin Jones.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Judge: Two of the most efficient are enow.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Sheriff: And ’t please your lordship, these are all
but one.’</p>

<p class='c007'>This ‘ap,’ the Welsh equivalent of our English
‘son,’ when it has come before a name beginning with
a vowel, has in many instances become incorporated
with it. Thus ‘Ap-Hugh’ has given us ‘Pugh,’ ‘Ap-Rice,’
just mentioned, ‘Price,’ or as ‘Reece,’ ‘Preece;’
‘Ap-Owen,’ ‘Bowen;’ ‘Ap-Evan,’ ‘Bevan;’ ‘Ap-Robert,’
‘Probert;’ ‘Ap-Roger,’ ‘Prodger;’ ‘Ap-Richard,’
‘Pritchard;’ ‘Ap-Humphrey,’ ‘Pumphrey;’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>‘Ap-Ithell,’ ‘Bethell;’<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c009'><sup>[4]</sup></a> or ‘Ap-Howell,’ ‘Powell.’<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c009'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
‘Prosser’ has generally been thought a corruption of
‘proser,’ one who was garrulously inclined; but this is
a mistake, it is simply ‘Ap-Rosser.’ The Norman
patronymic was formed similarly as the Welsh, by a
prefix, that of ‘fitz,’ the modern French ‘fils.’ Surnames
of this class were at first common. Thus we
find such names as ‘Fitz-Gibbon,’ ‘Fitz-Gerald,’ ‘Fitz-Patrick,’
‘Fitz-Waryn,’ ‘Fitz-Rauf,’ ‘Fitz-Payn,’ ‘Fitz-Richard,’
or ‘Fitz-Neele.’ But though this obtained
for awhile among some of the nobler families of our
country, it has made in general no sensible impression
upon our surnames. The Saxon added ‘son,’ as
a desinence, as ‘Williamson,’ that is, ‘William’s son,’
or ‘Bolderson,’ that is, ‘Baldwin’s son,’ or merely the
genitive suffix, as ‘Williams,’ or ‘Richards.’ This class
has been wonderfully enlarged by the custom then in
vogue, as now, of reducing every baptismal name to
some curt and familiar monosyllable. It agreed with
the rough-and-ready humour of the Anglo-Norman
character so to do. How common this was we may
see from Gower’s description of the insurrection of
Wat Tyler:</p>

<p class='c017'>Or let the author of ‘Piers Plowman’ speak. ‘Glutton’
having been seduced to the alehouse door, we are
told—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>‘Dawe’ the dykere, and a dozen othere.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>In these two quotations we see at once the clue to
the extraordinary number of patronymics our directories
contain of these short and curtailed forms.
Thus ‘Dawe,’ from ‘David,’ gives us ‘Dawson,’ or
‘Dawes;’ ‘Hikke’ from ‘Isaac,’ ‘Hickson,’ or
‘Hicks;’ ‘Watte,’ from ‘Walter,’ ‘Watson,’ or ‘Watts.’
Nor was this all. A large addition was made to this
category by the introduction of a further element.
This arose from the nursery practice of giving pet
names. Much as this is done now, it would seem to
have been still more common then. In either period
the method has been the same—that of turning the
name into a diminutive. Our very word ‘pet’ itself
is but the diminutive ‘petite,’ or ‘little one.’ The
fashion adopted, however, was different. We are
fond of using ‘ie,’ or ‘ley.’ Thus with us ‘John’
becomes ‘Johnnie,’ ‘Edward,’ ‘Teddie,’ ‘Charles,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>‘Charley.’ In early days the four diminutives in use
were those of ‘kin,’ ‘cock,’ and the terminations ‘ot’
or ‘et,’ and ‘on’ or ‘en,’ the two latter being of Norman-French
origin.</p>
<p class='c007'>1. <i>Kin.</i>—This Saxon term, corresponding with
the German ‘chen,’ and the French ‘on’ or ‘en,’
referred to above, and introduced, most probably, so
far as the immediate practice was concerned, by the
Flemings, we still preserve in such words as ‘manikin,’
‘pipkin,’ ‘lambkin,’ or ‘doitkin.’ This is very familiar
as a nominal adjunct. Thus, in an old poem, entitled
‘A Litul soth Sermun,’ we find the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nor those prude yongemen</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That loveth ‘Malekyn,’</div>
      <div class='line'>And those prude maydenes</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That loveth ‘Janekyn;’</div>
      <div class='line'>At chirche and at chepynge</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When they togadere come</div>
      <div class='line'>They runneth togaderes</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And speaketh of derne love.</div>
      <div class='line in5'>————</div>
      <div class='line'>Masses and matins</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ne kepeth they nouht,</div>
      <div class='line'>For ‘Wilekyn’ and ‘Watekyn’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Be in their thouht—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Hence we have derived such surnames as ‘Simpkins’
and ‘Simpkinson,’ ‘Thompkins’ and ‘Tomkinson.’</p>
<p class='c007'>2. <i>Cock.</i>—Our nursery literature still secures in
its ‘cock-robins,’ ‘cock-boats,’ and ‘cock-horses,’ the
immortality of this second termination. It forms an
important element in such names as ‘Simcox,’ ‘Jeffcock,’
‘Wilcock,’ or ‘Wilcox,’ and ‘Laycock’ (Lawrence).</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>Ot</i> or <i>et</i>.—These terminations were introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>by the Normans, and certainly have made an impregnable
position for themselves in our English nomenclature.
In our dictionaries they are found in such
diminutives as ‘pocket’ (little poke), ‘ballot,’ ‘chariot,’
‘target,’ ‘latchet,’ ‘lancet;’ in our directories in such
names as ‘Emmett,’ or ‘Emmot’ (Emma), ‘Tillotson’
(Matilda), ‘Elliot’ (Elias), ‘Marriot’ (Mary), ‘Willmot’
(Willamot), and ‘Hewet,’ or ‘Hewetson’ (Hugh).<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c009'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>4. <i>On</i> or <i>en</i>.—These terminations became very
popular with the French, and their directories teem
with the evidences they display of former favour.
They are all but unknown to our English dictionary,
but many traces of their presence may be found in
our nomenclature. Thus ‘Robert’ became ‘Robin,’
‘Nicol’ ‘Colin,’ ‘Pierre’ ‘Perrin,’ ‘Richard’ ‘Diccon,’
‘Mary’ ‘Marion,’ ‘Alice’ ‘Alison,’ ‘Beatrice’ ‘Beton,’
‘Hugh’ ‘Huon,’ or ‘Huguon’; and hence such surnames
as ‘Colinson,’ ‘Perrin,’ ‘Dicconson,’ ‘Allison’ (in
some cases), ‘Betonson,’ ‘Huggins,’ and ‘Hugginson.’<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c009'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I have already said that the Norman invasion
revolutionised our system of personal names. Certainly
it is in this the antagonism between Norman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and Saxon is especially manifest. Occasionally, in
looking over the records of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, we may light upon a ‘Godwin,’ or ‘Guthlac,’
or ‘Goddard,’ but they are of the most exceptional
occurrence. Were the local part of these entries
foreign, explanation would be unneeded. But while
the personal element is foreign, the local denotes
settlement from the up-country. Look at the London
population of this period from such records as we
possess. There is scarcely a hamlet, however small,
that does not contribute to swell the sum of the
metropolitan mass, and while ‘London’ itself is of
comparatively great rarity in our nomenclature, an
insignificant village like, say Debenham, in Suffolk,
will have its score of representatives—so great was
the flow, so small the ebb. It is this large accession
from the interior which is the stronghold of Saxon
nomenclature. It is this removal from one village to
another, and from one town to another, which has
originated that distich quoted by old Vestigan—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In ‘ford,’ in ‘ham,’ in ‘ley,’ in ‘ton,’</div>
      <div class='line'>The most of English surnames run.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>And yet, strange as it may seem, it is very doubtful
whether for a lengthened period, at least, the owners
of these names were of Saxon origin. The position
of the Saxon peasantry forbade that they should be
in any but a small degree accessory to this increase.
The very villenage they lived under, the very manner
in which they were attached to the glebe, rendered
any such roving tendencies as these impossible.
These country adventurers, then, whose names I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>have instanced, were of no Saxon stock, but the sons
of the humbler dependants of those Normans who
had obtained landed settlements, or of Norman
traders who had travelled up the country, fixing
their habitation wheresoever the wants of an increasing
people seemed to give them an opportunity of
gaining a livelihood. The children of such, driven
out of these smaller communities by the fact that
there was no further opening for them, poor as the
villeins amongst whom they dwelt, but different in
that they were free, would naturally resort to the
metropolis and other large centres of industry. Not
a few, however, would belong to the free Saxons, who,
much against their will, no doubt, but for the sake of
gain, would pass in the community to which they had
joined themselves by the name belonging to the more
powerful and mercantile party. In the same way,
too, some not small proportion of these names would
belong to those Saxon serfs who, having escaped
their bondage, would, on reaching the towns, change
their names to elude detection. These, of course,
would be got from the Norman category. But be all
this as it may, the fact remains that throughout all
the records and rolls of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, we find, with but the rarest exceptions, all
our personal names to be Norman. The Saxon
seems to have become well-nigh extinct. There
might have been a war of extermination against
them. In an unbroken succession we meet with
such names as ‘John’ and ‘Richard,’ ‘Robert’ and
‘Henry,’ ‘Thomas’ and ‘Ralph,’ ‘Geoffrey’ and ‘Jordan,’
‘Stephen’ and ‘Martin,’ ‘Joscelyn’ and ‘Almaric,’
‘Benedict’ and ‘Laurence,’ ‘Reginald’ and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>‘Gilbert,’ ‘Roger’ and ‘Walter,’ ‘Eustace’ and
‘Baldwin,’ ‘Francis’ and ‘Maurice,’ ‘Theobald’ and
‘Cecil,’—no ‘Edward,’ no ‘Edmund,’ no ‘Harold’
even, saving in very isolated cases. It is the same
with female names. While ‘Isabel’ and ‘Matilda,’
‘Mirabilla’ and ‘Avelina,’ ‘Amabilla’ and ‘Idonia,’
‘Sibilla’ and ‘Ida,’ ‘Letitia’ and ‘Agnes,’ ‘Petronilla’
or ‘Parnel’ and ‘Lucy,’ ‘Alicia’ and ‘Avice,’ ‘Alianora,’
or ‘Anora’ and ‘Dowsabell,’ ‘Clarice’ and
‘Muriel,’ ‘Agatha’ and ‘Rosamund,’ ‘Felicia’ and
‘Adelina,’ ‘Julia’ and ‘Blanche,’ ‘Isolda’ and ‘Amelia’
or ‘Emilia,’ ‘Beatrix’ and ‘Euphemia,’ ‘Annabel’
and ‘Theophania,’ ‘Constance’ and ‘Joanna’
abound; ‘Etheldreda,’ or ‘Edith,’ or ‘Ermentrude,’
all of the rarest occurrence, are the only names which
may breathe to us of purely Saxon times. In the
case of several, however, a special effort was made
later on, when the policy of allaying the jealous feelings
of the popular class was resorted to. For a
considerable time the royal and chief baronial families
had in their pride sought names for their children
from the Norman category merely. After the lapse
of a century, however, finding the Saxon spirit still
chafed and uneasy under a foreign thrall, several
names of a popular character were introduced into
the royal nursery. Thus was it with ‘Edward’ and
‘Edmund.’ The former of these appellations was
represented by Edward I., the latter by his brother
Edmund, Earl of Lancaster. Previously to this, too,
an attempt had been made to restore the British
‘Arthur’ in that nephew of Cœur de Lion who so
miserably perished by his uncle’s means, and thereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>gave Lackland a securer hold upon the English
throne, if not upon the affections of the country. The
sad and gloomy mystery which surrounded the disappearance
of this boy-prince seems to have inspired
mothers with a superstitious awe of the name, for we
do not find, as in the case of ‘Edward’ or ‘Edmund,’
its royal restoration having the effect of making it
general.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c009'><sup>[8]</sup></a> On the contrary, as an effort in its favour,
it seems to have signally failed. Of all our early
historic names I find fewest relics of this.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulty of subdividing our first chapter is
great, but for the sake of convenience we have decided
to preserve the following order:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. Names that preceded and survived the Conquest.</div>
      <div class='line'>2. Names introduced or confirmed by the Normans.</div>
      <div class='line'>3. Names from the Calendar of the Saints.</div>
      <div class='line'>4. Names from Festivals and Holy-days.</div>
      <div class='line'>5. Patronymics formed from occupations and officerships.</div>
      <div class='line'>6. Metronymics.</div>
      <div class='line'>7. Names from Holy Scripture.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c020'>I.—<i>Names that preceded and survived the Conquest.</i></h3>

<p class='c018'>The peculiar feature of the great majority of such
names as were in vogue previous to the Norman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Conquest, and which to a certain extent maintained a
hold, is that (saving in two or three instances) they
did not attach to themselves either filial or pet
desinences. If they have come down to us as surnames,
they are found in their simple unaltered dress.
Thus, taking Afred as an example, we see in our
directories ‘Alfred’ or ‘Alured’ or ‘Allured’ to be
the only patronymics that have been handed down to
us. Latinized as Aluredus it figures in Domesday.
The Hundred Rolls, later on, register an Alured Ape,
and the surname appears in the Parliamentary
Writs in the case of William Alured. It is hard to
separate our ‘Aldreds’ from our ‘Allureds.’ The
usually entered forms are ‘Richard Alred,’ ‘Hugh
Aldred,’ or ‘Aldred fil. Roger.’ Besides ‘Aldred’
there is ‘Alderson,’ which may be but ‘Aldredson.’
Aylwin is met by such entries as Richard Alwine, or
Thomas Ailwyne: ‘Adelard,’ as ‘Adlard’ or ‘Alard,’
and ‘Agilward’ as ‘Aylward,’ are of more frequent
occurrence; while Aldrech, once merely a personal
name, is now, like many of the above, found only
surnominally.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Teutonic mythology is closely interwoven in
several of these names. The primary root ‘god’ or
‘good,’ which stood in all Teuton languages as the title
of divinity, was familiarised as the chief component in
not a few of our still existing surnames. ‘Godwin,’ the
name which the stout old earl of Danish blood has given
to our Goodwin Sands, seems to have been well established
when the great Survey was made. The French
‘Godin’ seems scarcely to have crossed the Channel,
but ‘Godwin’ and ‘Goodwin’ have well filled up the
gap. ‘Hugh fil. Godewin,’ or ‘Godwin de Dovre,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>represent our registers. Our ‘Godbolds’ are found
in the dress of ‘Godbolde,’ our ‘Goodiers’ and ‘Goodyears’
as ‘Goder’ or ‘Godyer,’ and our ‘Goddards’
as ‘Godard.’ The Hundred Rolls give us a ‘John fil.
Godard.’ The Alpine mountain reminds us of its
connection with ‘Gotthard,’ and Miss Yonge states
that it is still in use as a Christian name in Germany.
‘Gottschalk,’ a common surname in the same country,
was well known as a personal name in England in the
forms of ‘Godescalde,’<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c009'><sup>[9]</sup></a> ‘Godescall,’ or ‘Godeschalke,’
such entries as ‘Godefry fil. Godescallus,’ or ‘Godeskalcus
Armorer,’ or ‘John Godescalde,’ being not unfrequent.
The latter name suggests to us our ‘Godsalls’
and ‘Godshalls’ as the present English surnominal
forms. ‘Gottschalk’ in our directories may
always be looked upon as a more recent importation
from Germany. Goderic was perhaps the commonest
of this class—its usual dress in our registers being
‘Gooderick,’ ‘Goderiche,’ ‘Godrick,’ and ‘Godric.’
An early Saxon abbot was exalted into the ranks of
the saints as ‘St. Goderic,’ and this would have its
influence in the selection of baptismal names at that
period. ‘Guthlac,’ not without descendants, too,
though less easily recognisable in our ‘Goodlakes’
and ‘Goodlucks,’ and ‘Geoffrey,’ or ‘Godfrey,’ whom
I shall have occasion to mention again, belong to the
same category.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c009'><sup>[10]</sup></a> The last of this class I may mention
is the old ‘Godeberd,’ or ‘Godbert.’ As simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>‘Godeberd’ it is found in such a name as ‘Roger
Godeberd,’ met with in the London Tower records.
Somewhat more corrupted we come across a ‘John
Gotebedde’ in the Hundred Rolls of the thirteenth
century; and much about the same time a ‘Robert
Gotobedd’ lived in Winchelsea. In this latter form,
I need scarcely say, it has now a somewhat flourishing
existence in our midst. Some will be reminded of
the lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Mr. Barker’s as mute as a fish in the sea,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Mr. Miles never moves on a journey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mr. Gotobed sits up till half-after three,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Mr. Makepeace was bred an attorney.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Still, despite its long antiquity, when I recall the pretty
Godbert from which it arose, I would, were I one of
them, <i>go to bed</i> as such some night for the last time,
nor get up again till I could dress, if not my person,
at least my personality in its real and more antique
habiliment.</p>
<p class='c007'>‘Os,’ as a root-word implicative of deity, has made
for itself a firm place in our ‘Osbalds,’ ‘Osberts,’ ‘Oswins,’
‘Oswalds,’ ‘Osbornes,’ and ‘Osmunds’ or ‘Osmonds.’
Instances of all these may be seen in our older
registries. We quickly light upon entries such as ‘Osbert
le Ferrur,’ ‘Osborne le Hawkere,’ ‘Oswin Ogle,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>‘Nicholas Osemund,’ or ‘John Oswald.’ Nor must
‘Thor,’ the ‘Jupiter tonans’ of the Norsemen, be left
out, for putting aside local names, and the day of the
week that still memorialises him, we have yet several
surnames that speak of his influence. ‘Thurstan’
and ‘Thurlow’ seem both of kin. ‘Thorald,’ however,
has made the greatest mark, and next ‘Thurkell.’
Thorald may be seen in ‘Torald Chamberlain’ (A),
Ralph fil. Thorald (A), or Torald Benig (A); while
Thurkell or Thurkill is found first in the fuller form
in such entries as ‘Richard Thyrketyll,’ or ‘Robert
Thirkettle,’ and then in the contracted in ‘Thurkeld
le Seneschal,’ or ‘Robert Thurkel.’</p>

<p class='c007'>We have just referred to Thurkettle. ‘Kettle’
was very closely connected with the mythology of
Northern Europe, and is still a great name in Norway
and in Iceland. The sacrificial cauldron of the gods
must certainly have been vividly present to the
imagination of our forefathers. The list of names
compounded with ‘Kettle’ is large even in England.
The simple ‘Kettle’ was very common. In Domesday
it is ‘Chetill,’ in the Hundred Rolls ‘Ketel’ or
‘Cetyl’ or ‘Cattle.’ Such entries as ‘Ketel le Mercer,’
or ‘Chetel Frieday,’ or ‘Cattle Bagge,’ are met with
up to the fifteenth century, and as surnames ‘Kettle,’
‘Chettle’ and ‘Cattle’ or ‘Cattell’ have a well-established
place in the nineteenth. Of the compound forms
we have already noticed ‘Thurkettle’ or ‘Thurkell.’
‘Anketil le Mercir’ (A), ‘Roger Arketel’ (A), ‘William
Asketill’ (Q), and ‘Robert fil. Anskitiel’ (W. 12) are
all but changes rung on Oskettle. The abbots of
England, in 941, 992, and 1052, were ‘Turketyl,’
‘Osketyl,’ and ‘Wulfketyl’ respectively. The last seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>to be the same as ‘Ulchetel’ found in Domesday.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c009'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
In the same Survey we light upon a ‘Steinchetel,’ and
‘Grinketel’ is also found in a Yorkshire record of the
same period.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c009'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Orm, the representative of pagan worship
in respect of the serpent, has left its memorial in
such entries as ‘Alice fil. Orme,’ or ‘Ormus Archbragge.’
The descendants of these are our ‘Ormes’
and ‘Ormesons.’ More local names abide in ‘Ormsby,’
‘Ormskirk,’ ‘Ormerod,’ and ‘Ormes Head.’</p>

<p class='c007'>A series of names, some of them connected with
the heroic and legendary lore of Northern Europe,
were formed from the root ‘sig’—conquest. Many
of these maintained a position as personal names
long after the Norman invasion, and now exist in our
directories as surnames. Nevertheless, as with the
others hitherto mentioned, they are all but invariably
found in their simple and uncompounded form. Our
‘Sewards,’ ‘Seawards,’ and ‘Sawards’ represent the
chief of these. It is found in England in the seventh
century, and was a great Danish name. Entries like
‘Syward Godwin’ or ‘Siward Oldcorn’ are found as
late as the beginning of the fourteenth century.
Next we may mention our ‘Segars,’ ‘Sagars,’ ‘Sahers,’
‘Sayers,’ and ‘Saers,’ undoubted descendants of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>such men as ‘Saher de Quincy,’ the famous old Earl
of Winchester. The registrations of this as a personal
name are very frequent. Such entries as ‘John
fil. Saer,’ ‘Saher Clerk,’ ‘Saher le King,’ or ‘Eudo fil.
Sygar,’ are common. Nor has ‘Sigbiorn’ been allowed
to become obsolete, as our ‘Sibornes’ and
‘Seabornes’ can testify. I cannot discover any instance
of ‘Sibbald’ as a personal name after the
Domesday Survey, but as a relic of ‘Sigbald’ it is
still living in a surnominal form. Though apparently
occupative, our registers clearly proclaim that ‘Seman’
or ‘Seaman’ must be set here. As a personal name
it is found in such designations as ‘Seman de Champagne,’
or ‘Seaman de Baylif,’ or ‘Seaman Carpenter.’
With the mention of ‘Sebright’ as a corruption of
‘Sigbert’ or ‘Sebert,’ I pass on; but this is sufficient
to show that a name whose root-meaning implied
heroism was popular with our forefathers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The popular notion that ‘Howard’ is nothing but
‘Hogward’ is not borne out by facts. We find no
trace whatever of its gradual reduction into such a
corrupt form. As we shall have occasion to show
hereafter, it is our ‘Hoggarts’ who thus maintain the
honours of our swine-tending ancestors. There can
be little doubt, indeed, that ‘Howard’ is but another
form of ‘Harvard’ or ‘Hereward.’ That it had early
become so pronounced and spelt we can prove by an
entry occurring in the Test. Ebor. (Surt. Soc.) where
one ‘John Fitz-howard’ is registered. Our ‘Hermans’
and ‘Harmans’ represent ‘Herman,’ a name which,
though in early use in England, we owe chiefly to
immigration in later days. Such entries as ‘Herman
de Francia’ or ‘Herman de Alemannia’ are occasionally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>met with. The fuller patronymic attached itself to
this name; hence such entries as ‘Walter Hermanson,’
and ‘John Urmynson,’ ‘Harmer,’ and ‘Hermer,’
seem to be somewhat of kin to the last. The personal
form is found in ‘Robert fil. Hermer,’ and the
surname in ‘Hopkins Harmar.’ Besides ‘Hardwin,’
‘Hadwin’ is also met with as a relic of the same,
while ‘Harding’ has remained unaltered from the day
when registrars entered such names as ‘Robert fil.
Harding’ and ‘Maurice fil. Harding;’ but this, as
‘Fitz-harding’ reminds us, must be looked upon as of
Norman introduction. Nor must ‘Swain’ be forgotten.
We find in the Survey the wife of ‘Edward
filius Suani,’ figuring among the tenants-in-chief of
Essex. This is of course but our present ‘Swainson’
or ‘Swanson;’ and when we add all the ‘Swains,’
‘Swayns,’ and ‘Swaynes’ of our directories we shall
find that this name has a tolerably assured position
in the nineteenth century. ‘Swain’ implied strength,
specially the strength of youth; and as Samson’s
strength became utter weakness through his affection,
so I suppose it has fared with ‘Swain.’ The country
shepherd piping to his mistress, the lovesick bachelor,
has monopolised the title. As a personal name it occurs
in such registrations as ‘Sweyn Colle,’ ‘Swanus
le Riche,’ or ‘Adam fil. Swain.’</p>
<h3 class='c020'>II.—<i>Names introduced or confirmed by the Normans.</i></h3>

<p class='c018'>Of names specially introduced at the Conquest, or
that received an impulse by that event, we may mention
‘Serl’ and ‘Harvey.’ ‘Serl,’ found in such
names as ‘Serle Morice’ or ‘Serle Gotokirke,’ or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>‘John fil. Serlo,’ still abides in our ‘Searles’ and
‘Serles,’ ‘Serrells’ and ‘Serlsons.’ ‘William Serleson’
occurs in an old Yorkshire register, and ‘Richard
Serelson’ in the Parliamentary Writs. The Norman
diminutive also appears in Matilda Sirlot (A) and
Mabel Sirlot (A).<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c009'><sup>[13]</sup></a> ‘Harvey,’ or ‘Herve,’ was more
common than many may imagine, and a fair number
of entries such as ‘Herveus le Gos’ or ‘William fil.
Hervei,’ may be seen in all our large rolls. The
Malvern poet in his ‘Piers Plowman’ employs the
name:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And thanne cam Coveitise,</div>

      <div class='line'>So hungrily and holwe</div>
      <div class='line'>Sire Hervy hym loked.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Arnold,’ now almost unknown in England as a
baptismal name, made a deep impression on our
nomenclature, as it did on that of Central Europe.
‘Earn’ for the eagle is a word not yet obsolete in the
North of England, and this reminds us of the origin
of the name. This kinship is more easily traceable
in our registries where the usual forms are ‘Ernaldus
Carnifix,’ or ‘Peter Ernald.’ Besides ‘Arnold,’ ‘Arnison,’
and the diminutive ‘Arnott’ or ‘Arnet’<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c009'><sup>[14]</sup></a> still
live among us. ‘Alberic,’ or ‘Albrec,’ as we find it
occasionally written, soon found its way into our
rolls as ‘Aubrey,’ although, as Ælfric, Miss Yonge
shows it to have existed in our country centuries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>earlier.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c009'><sup>[15]</sup></a> ‘Albred,’ probably but another form of the
lately revived ‘Albert,’ is now found as ‘Allbright’
and the German ‘Albrecht.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Emery,’ though now utterly forgotten as a personal
name, may be said to live on only in our surnames.
It was once no unimportant sobriquet. ‘Americ,’
‘Almeric,’ ‘Almaric,’ ‘Emeric,’ and ‘Eimeric,’ seem
to have been its original spellings in England, and
thus, at least, it is more likely to remind us that it is
the same name to which, in the Italian form of
Amerigo, we now owe the title of that vast expanse
of western territory which is so indissolubly connected
with English industry and English interests. Curter
forms than these were found in ‘Aylmar,’ ‘Ailmar,’
‘Almar,’ and ‘Aymer,’ and ‘Amar.’ The surnames
it has bequeathed to us are not few. It has had
the free run of the vowels in our ‘Amorys,’ ‘Emerys,’
and ‘Imarys,’ and in a more patronymic form we
may still oftentimes meet with it in our ‘Emersons,’
‘Embersons,’<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c009'><sup>[16]</sup></a> and ‘Imesons.’ ‘Ingram’ represents
the old ‘Ingelram,’ ‘Engleram,’ ‘Iggelram,’ or ‘Ingeram,’
for all these forms may be met with; and
‘Ebrardus,’ later on registered as ‘Eborard,’ still
abides hale and hearty in our ‘Everards’ and ‘Everys.’
The latter, however, can scarcely be said to be quite
extinct as a baptismal name. ‘Waleran,’ an English
form of the foreign ‘Valerian,’ is found in such an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>entry as ‘Walerand Berchamstead,’ or ‘Waldrand
Clark,’ or ‘Walran Oldman.’ We see at once the
origin of our ‘Walronds’ and ‘Walrands.’ The name
of ‘Brice’ begins to find itself located in England at
this time. Hailing from Denmark, it may have come
in with the earlier raids from that shore, or later on in
the more peaceful channels of trade. The Hundred
Rolls furnish us with ‘Brice fil. William’ and ‘Brice le
Parsun,’ while the Placita de Quo Warranto gives
us a ‘Brice le Daneys,’ who himself proclaims the
nationality of the name. The Norman diminutive is
met with in ‘Briccot de Brainton’ (M M). ‘Brice’ and
‘Bryson’ (when not a corruption of ‘Bride-son’) are
the present representatives of this now forgotten
name.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c009'><sup>[17]</sup></a> All the above names I have placed together,
because, while introduced or receiving an impetus by
the incoming of the Normans and their followers, they
have, nevertheless, made little impression on our general
nomenclature. The fact that, with but one or two exceptions,
the usual pet addenda, ‘kin,’ ‘cock,’ and ‘ot,’
or ‘et,’ are absolutely wanting, or even the patronymic
‘son,’ shows decisively that they cannot be numbered
among what we must call the popular names of the
period. Introduced here and there in the community
at large, they struggled on for bare existence, and
have descended to us as surnames in their simple
and unaltered form.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>We now turn to a batch of personal names of a
different character, names which, with a few exceptions,
are still familiar to us at baptismal celebrations,
and which have changed themselves into so many
varying forms, that the surnames issuing from them
are well-nigh legion. Most of these are the direct
result of the Conquest. They are either the sobriquets
borne by William, his family, and his leading followers,
or by those whom connections of blood,
alliance, and interest afterwards brought into the
country. Many others received their solid settlement
in England through the large immigration of foreign
artisans from Normandy, from Picardy, Anjou, Flanders,
and other provinces. The Flemish influence has
been very strong.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will first mention Drew, Warin, Paine, Ivo, and
Hamon, because, although they must be included
among the most familiar names of their time, they
are now practically disused at the font. ‘Drew,’ or
‘Drogo,’ occurs several times in Domesday. An
illegitimate son of Charlemagne was so styled, and,
doubtless, it owed its familiarity to the adherents of
the Conqueror. Later on, at any rate, it was firmly
established, as such names as Drew Drewery, Druco
Bretun, or William fil. Drogo testify. That ‘Drewett’
is derived from the Norman diminutive can be proved
from the Hundred Rolls, wherein the same man is
described in the twofold form of ‘Drogo Malerbe’
and ‘Druett Malerbe.’ The feminine ‘Druetta de
Pratello’ is also found in the same records. ‘Drew’
and ‘Drewett’ are both in our directories.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c009'><sup>[18]</sup></a> Few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>names were more common from the eleventh to the
fourteenth century than ‘Warin,’ or ‘Guarin,’ or
‘Guerin’—the latter the form at present generally
found in France. It is the sobriquet that is incorporated
in our ancient ‘Mannerings,’ or ‘Mainwarings,’
a family that came from the ‘mesnil,’ or
‘manor,’ of ‘Warin,’ in a day when that was a
familiar Christian name in Norman households. A
few generations later on we find securely settled
among ourselves such names as ‘Warin Chapman,’
or ‘Warinus Gerold,’ or ‘Guarinus Banastre,’ in the
baptismal, and ‘Warinus Fitz-Warin,’ or ‘John Warison,’
in the patronymic form, holding a steady place in
our mediæval rolls. Two of the characters in ‘Piers
Plowman,’ as those who have read it will remember,
bear this as their personal sobriquet:—</p>

      <div class='line'>And warnede wrong.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Robert Warinot,’ in the Hundred Rolls, and ‘William
Warinot’ in the Placita de Quo Warranto,
reveal the origin of our ‘Warnetts;’ while our ‘Wareings,’
‘Warings,’ ‘Warisons,’ ‘Wasons,’ and ‘Fitz-Warins’—often
written ‘Fitz-Warren’—not to mention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the majority of our ‘Warrens,’<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c009'><sup>[19]</sup></a> are other of the
descendants of this famous old name that still survive.
A favourite name in these days was ‘Payn,’ or ‘Pagan.’
The softer form is given us in the ‘Man of Lawes
Tale’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Constable, and Dame Hermegild his wife,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were payenes, and that country everywhere.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We all know the history of the word; how that, while
the Gospel had made advance in the cities, but not
yet penetrated into the country, the dwellers in the
latter became looked upon with a something of contempt
as idolaters, so that, so far as this word was
concerned, ‘countryman’ and ‘false-worshipper’ became
synonymous terms. In fact, ‘pagan’ embraced
the two meanings that ‘peasant’ and ‘pagan’ now
convey, though the root of both is the same. The
Normans, it would appear, must have so styled some
of themselves who had refused baptism after that
their chieftain, Rollo, had become a convert; and
hence, when William came over, the name was introduced
into England by several of his followers. In
Domesday Book we find among his tenants-in-chief
the names of ‘Ralph Paganel’ and ‘Edmund
fil. Pagani.’ The name became more popular as time
went on, and it is no exaggeration to say that at one
period—viz., the close of the Norman dynasty—it had
threatened to become one of the most familiar appellatives
in England. This will account for the frequency
with which we meet such entries in the past
as ‘Robert fil. Pain,’ ‘Pain del Ash,’ ‘Pagan de la
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Hale,’ ‘Roger fil. Pagan,’ ‘Payen le Dubbour,’ or
‘Elis le Fitz-Payn,’ and such surnames in the present
as ‘Pagan,’ ‘Payne,’ ‘Payn,’ ‘Paine,’ ‘Pain,’ and
‘Pynson.’ The diminutive also was not wanting, as
‘John Paynett’ (Z) or ‘Emma Paynot’ (W 2) could
have testified. Thus, while in our dictionaries ‘pagan’
still represents a state of heathenism, in our directories
it has long ago been converted to the uses of Christianity,
and become at the baptismal font a Christian
name. ‘Ivar,’ or ‘Iver,’ still familiarised to Scotchmen
in ‘Mac-Iver,’ came to the Normans from the
northern lands whence they were sprung, and with
them into England. It was not its first appearance
here, as St. Ives of Huntingdonshire could have
testified in the seventh century. Still its popular
character was due to the Norman. Such names as
‘Yvo de Taillbois’ (1211), mentioned in Bishop Pudsey’s
‘Survey of the Durham See,’ ‘Ivo le Mercer,’
‘Walter fil. Ive,’ ‘William Iveson,’ ‘Iveta Millisent,’
or ‘John fil. Ivette,’ serve to show us how familiar
was this appellation with both sexes.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c009'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Nor are its
descendants inclined to let its memory die. We have
the simple ‘Ive’ and ‘Ives;’ we have the more
patronymic ‘Iverson,’ ‘Ivison,’ ‘Iveson,’ and ‘Ison,’
and the pet ‘Ivetts’ and ‘Ivatts,’ the latter possibly
feminine in origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Hamo,’ or ‘Hamon,’ requires a paragraph for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>itself. It is firmly imbedded in our existing nomenclature,
and has played an important part in its time.
Its forms were many, and though obsolete as baptismal
names, all have survived as surnames. Of these may
be mentioned our ‘Hamons,’ ‘Haymons,’ ‘Aymons,’
and ‘Fitz-Aymons.’ Formed like ‘Rawlyn,’ ‘Thomlin,’
and ‘Cattlin,’ it bequeathed us ‘Hamlyn,’ a relic
of such folk as ‘Hamelyn de Trap’ or ‘Osbert
Hamelyn.’ Another change rung on the name is
traceable in such entries as ‘Hamund le Mestre,’
‘Hamond Cobeler,’ or ‘John Fitz-Hamond,’ the
source of our ‘Hammonds’ and ‘Hamonds;’ while
in ‘Alice Hamundson’ or ‘William Hamneson’ we
see the lineage of our many ‘Hampsons.’ But these
are the least important. The Norman-French diminutive,
‘Hamonet,’ speedily corrupted into ‘Hamnet’
and ‘Hammet,’ became one of our favourite baptismal
names, and towards the reign of Elizabeth one of the
commonest. A ‘Hamnet de Dokinfield’ is found so
early as 1270 at Manchester (Didsbury Ch. Cheth.
Soc.). Shakespeare’s son was baptized ‘Hamnet,’
and was so called after ‘Hamnet Sadler,’ a friend of
the poet’s—a baker at Stratford. This man is styled
‘Hamlet’ also, reminding us of another pet form of the
name. We have already mentioned ‘Richard,’ ‘Christian,’ ‘Hugh,’
and ‘Hobbe,’ as severally giving birth
to the diminutives, ‘Rickelot,’ ‘Crestelot,’ ‘Huelot,’
and ‘Hobelot.’ In the same way, ‘Hamon’ became
‘Hamelot,’ or ‘Hamelet,’ hence such entries as
‘Richard, son of Hamelot’ (AA 2), and ‘Hamelot de
la Burste’ (Cal. and Inv. of Treasury). Out of
fifteen ‘Hamnets’ set down in ‘Wills and Inventories’
(Cheth. Soc.), six are recorded as ‘Hamlet,’ one being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>set down in both forms as ‘Hamnet Massey’ and
‘Hamlet Massey’ (cf. i. 148, ii. 201). If the reader
will look through the index of Blomefield’s ‘Norfolk,’
he will find that ‘Hamlet’ in that county had taken
the entire place of ‘Hamnet.’ Amid a large number
of the former I cannot find one of the latter. It would
be a curious question how far Shakespeare was biassed
by the fact of having a ‘Hamlet’ in his nursery into
changing ‘Hambleth’ (the original title of the story)
to the form he has now immortalized. An open Bible,
and, further on, a Puritan spirit have left their influence
on no name more markedly than ‘Hamon.’ As one
after another new Bible character was commemorated
at the font, ‘Hamon’ got crushed out. Its last refuge
has been found in our directories, for so long as our
‘Hamlets,’ ‘Hamnets,’ ‘Hammets,’ ‘Hammonds,’ and
‘Hampsons’ exist, it cannot be utterly forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Guy,’ or ‘Guyon,’ dates from the ‘Round Table,’
but it was reserved for the Norman to make his name
so familiar to English lips. The best proof of this is
that the surnames which it has left to us are all but
entirely formed from the Norman-French diminutive
‘Guyot,’ which in England became, of course, ‘Wyot.’
Hence such entries as ‘Wyot fil. Helias,’ or ‘Wyott
Carpenter,’ or ‘Wyot Balistarius.’ The descendants
of these, I need scarcely say, are our ‘Wyatts.’ But
the Norman initial was not entirely lost. ‘Aleyn
Gyot’ is found in the ‘Rolls of Parliament;’ and
‘Guyot’ and ‘Guyatt’ testify to its existence in the
nineteenth century.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c009'><sup>[21]</sup></a> ‘Ralph,’ or ‘Radulf,’ of whom
there were thirty-eight in Domesday, has survived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>in a number of forms. Our ‘Raffs’ and ‘Raffsons’
can carry back their descent to days when ‘Raffe
Barton’ or ‘Peter Raffson’ thus signed themselves.
The favourite pet forms were ‘Rawlin’ and ‘Randle;’
hence such entries as ‘Raulyn de la Fermerie,’ ‘Raulina
de Briston,’ or ‘Randle de la Mill.’ To these it
is we owe our ‘Rawlins,’ ‘Rawlings,’ ‘Rawlinsons,’
‘Rollins,’ ‘Rollinsons,’ ‘Randles’ and ‘Randalls.’ Other
and more ordinary corruptions are found in ‘Rawes,’
‘Rawson,’ ‘Rawkins,’ ‘Rapkins,’ and ‘Rapson.’ The
reader may easily see from this that ‘Ralph,’ from
occupying a place in the foremost rank of early
favourites, is content now to stand in the very rear.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are a number of names still in use, although
not so popular as they once were, which were brought
in directly by the Normans, and which were closely
connected with the real or imaginary stories of which
Charlemagne was the central figure. Italy, France,
and Spain possess a larger stock than we do of this
class, but those which did reach our shores made for
themselves a secure position. ‘Charles,’ by some
strange accident, did not obtain a place in England,
nor is it to be found in our registers, saving in the most
isolated instances, till Charles the First, by his misfortunes,
made it one of the commonest in the land.
In France, as Sir Walter Scott, in ‘Quentin Durward,’
reminds us, the pet form was ‘Charlot’ and ‘Charlat.’
This, as a surname, soon found its way to England,
where it has existed for many centuries. The feminine
‘Charlotte,’ since the death of the beloved Princess
of that name, has become almost a household word.
Putting aside ‘Charles,’ then, the Paladins have bequeathed
us ‘Roland,’ ‘Oliver,’ ‘Robert,’ ‘Richard,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>‘Roger,’ ‘Reginald,’ ‘Reynard,’ and ‘Miles.’ We see at
once in these names the parentage of some of our most
familiar surnames. ‘Oliver’ was, perhaps, the least
popular so far as numbers were concerned, and might
have died out entirely had not the Protector Cromwell
brought it again into notoriety. ‘Oliver,’ ‘Olver,’
‘Ollier,’ and ‘Oliverson’ are the present forms, and
these are met by such entries as ‘Jordan Olyver,’ or
‘Philip fil. Oliver.’ ‘Roland,’ or ‘Orlando,’ was the
nephew of the great Charles, who fell in his peerless
might at Roncesvalles. Of him and Oliver, Walter
Scott, translating the Norman chronicle, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>Taillefer, who sang both well and loud,</div>

      <div class='line'>Of Oliver and champions mo,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who died at fatal Roncevaux.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Roland’ was a favourite name among the higher
nobility for centuries, and with our ‘Rolands,’ ‘Rowlands,’
‘Rowlsons,’ and ‘Rowlandsons,’ bids fair to
maintain its hold upon our surnames, if not the baptismal
list. Old forms are found in such entries as
‘Roland le Lene,’ ‘Rouland Bloet,’ ‘William Rollandson,’
or ‘Robert Rowelyngsonne’! We must not
forget, too, that our ‘Rowletts’ and ‘Rowlets’ represent
the French diminutive.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c009'><sup>[22]</sup></a> ‘Robert’ is an instance
of a name which has held its place against all counter
influences from the moment which first brought it
into public favour. It is early made conspicuous in
the eldest son of the Bastard King who, through his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>miserable fate, became such an object of common
pity that, though of the hated stock, his sobriquet
became acceptable among the Saxons themselves.
From that time its fortunes were made, even had not
the bold archer of Sherwood Forest risen to the fore,
and caused ‘Hob’ to be the title of every other young
peasant you might meet ’twixt London and York. A
curious instance of the popularity of the latter is found
in the fact that a tradesman living in 1388 in Winchelsea
is recorded under the name of ‘Thomas
Robynhod.’ The diminutives ‘Robynet’<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c009'><sup>[23]</sup></a> and ‘Robertot’
are obsolete, but of other forms that still
thrive among us are ‘Roberts,’ ‘Robarts,’ ‘Robertson,’
‘Robins,’ ‘Robinson,’ ‘Robison,’ and ‘Robson.’ From
its shortened ‘Dob’ are ‘Dobbs,’ ‘Dobson,’ ‘Dobbins,’
‘Dobinson,’ and ‘Dobison.’<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c009'><sup>[24]</sup></a> From its equally
familiar ‘Hob’ are ‘Hobbs,’ ‘Hobson,’ ‘Hobbins,’
‘Hopkins,’ and ‘Hopkinson.’ From the Welsh, too,
we get, as contractions of ‘Ap-robert’ and ‘Ap-robin,’
‘Probert’ and ‘Probyn.’ Thus ‘Robert’ is not left
without remembrance. Richard was scarcely less
popular than Robert. Though already firmly established,
for Richard was in the Norman ducal genealogy
before William came over the water, still it was
reserved for the Angevine monarch, as he had made
it the terror of the Paynim, so to make it the pride
of the English heart. Richard I. is an instance of
a man’s many despicable qualities being forgotten in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the dazzling brilliance of daring deeds. He was an
ungrateful son, an unkind brother, a faithless husband;
but he was the idol of his time, and to him a large
mass of English people of to-day owe their <i>nominal</i>
existence. From the name proper we get ‘Richards’
and ‘Richardson,’ ‘Ricks’ and ‘Rix,’ ‘Rickson’ and
‘Rixon,’ or ‘Ritson,’ ‘Rickards,’ and ‘Ricketts.’<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c009'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
From the curter ‘Dick’ or ‘Diccon,’<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c009'><sup>[26]</sup></a> we derive
‘Dicks’ or ‘Dix,’ ‘Dickson’ or ‘Dixon,’ ‘Dickens’ or
‘Diccons,’ and ‘Dickenson’ or ‘Dicconson.’ From
‘Hitchin,’ once nearly as familiar as ‘Dick,’ we get
‘Hitchins,’ ‘Hitchinson,’ ‘Hitchcock,’ and ‘Hitchcox.’
Like many another name, the number of ‘Richards’
now is out of all proportion less than these surnames
would ascribe to it some centuries ago. The reason
of this we shall speak more particularly about by-and-by.
Roger, well known in France and Italy, found
much favour in England. From it we derive our
‘Rogers,’ ‘Rodgers,’ and ‘Rogersons.’ From Hodge,
its nickname, we acquired ‘Hodge,’ ‘Hodges,’ ‘Hodgkins,’
‘Hotchkins,’ ‘Hoskins,’ ‘Hodgkinson,’ ‘Hodgson,’
and ‘Hodson,’ and through the Welsh ‘Prodger.’
The diminutive ‘Rogercock’ is found once, but it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>ungainly, and I doubt not met with little favour.
Reginald, as Rinaldo, immortalized by the Italian
poet, appeared in Domesday as ‘Ragenald’ and
‘Rainald.’ Our ‘Reynolds,’ represent the surname.
‘Renaud’ or ‘Renard,’ can never be forgotten while
there is a single fox left to display its cunning. The
story seems to have been founded on the character
of some real personage, but his iniquities did not
frighten parents from the use of the name. ‘Renaud
Balistarius’ or ‘Adam fil. Reinaud’ are common
entries, and ‘Reynardsons’ and ‘Rennisons’ still
exist. Our ‘Rankins,’ too, would seem to have originated
from this sobriquet since ‘Gilbert Reynkin’
and ‘Richard Reynkyn’ are found in two separate rolls.
Miles came into England as ‘Milo,’ that being the
form found in Domesday. It was already popular
with the Normans, and, like all other personal names
from the same source, we find it speedily recorded in
a diminutive shape, as ‘Millot’ and ‘Millet.’ ‘Roger
Millot’ occurs in the Hundred Rolls, and ‘Thomas
Mylett’ in a Yorkshire register of an early date. The
patronymics were ‘Mills,’ ‘Miles,’ ‘Millson,’ and
‘Mileson,’<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c009'><sup>[27]</sup></a> all of which still exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great race for popularity since Domesday record
has ever been that between ‘William’ and ‘John.’
In the age immediately following the Conquest ‘William’
decidedly held the supremacy. This is naturally
accounted for by its royal associations. There was,
indeed, a ‘John’ in the same line of descent as the
Bastard from Richard I. of Normandy, but the name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>seems to have been forgotten, or passed by unheeded,
till it was revived again five generations later in ‘John
Lackland.’ ‘William’ enjoyed better auspices. It
was the name of the founder of the new monarchy.
It was the name of his immediate successor. Whatever
the character of these two kings, such a conjunction
could not but have its weight upon the especially
Norman element in the kingdom. We find in Domesday
that while there are 68 ‘Williams,’ 48 ‘Roberts,’
and 28 ‘Walters,’ there are only 10 ‘Johns.’ A century
later than this, ‘William’ must still have claimed
precedence among the nobility at least, as is proved
by a statement of Robert Montensis. He says, that
at a festival held in the court of Henry II., in 1173,
Sir William St. John and Sir William Fitz-Hamon,
especial officers, had commanded that none but those
of the name of ‘William’ should dine in the Great
Chamber with them, and were, therefore, accompanied
by one hundred and twenty ‘Williams,’ all knights. By
the time of Edward I. this disproportion had become
less marked. In a list of names connected with the
county of Wiltshire in that reign, we find, out of a
total of 588 decipherable names (for the record is
somewhat damaged), 92 ‘Williams’ to 88 ‘Johns,’
while ‘Richard’ is credited with 55; ‘Robert,’ 48;
‘Roger,’ 23; and ‘Geoffrey,’ ‘Ralph,’ and ‘Peter,’
each 16 names. This denotes clearly that a considerable
change had taken place in the popular estimation
of these two appellations. Within a century after
this, however, ‘John’ had evidently gained the supremacy.
In 1347, we find that out of 133 Common
Councilmen for London town first convened, 35 were
‘Johns,’ the next highest being 17 under the head of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>‘William,’ 15 under ‘Thomas,’ which now, for obvious
reasons we will mention hereafter, had suddenly
sprung into notoriety; 10 under ‘Richard,’ 9 under
‘Henry,’ 8 under ‘Robert,’ and so on; ending with
one each for ‘Laurence,’ ‘Reynald,’ ‘Andrew,’ ‘Alan,’
‘Giles,’ ‘Gilbert,’ and ‘Peter.’ A still greater disproportion
is found forty years later; for in 1385, the
Guild of St. George, at Norwich, out of a total of 376
names, possessed 128 ‘Johns’ to 47 ‘Williams’ and
41 ‘Thomases.’<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c009'><sup>[28]</sup></a> From this period, despite the hatred
that was felt for Lackland, ‘John’ kept the precedence
it had won, and to this circumstance the nation owes
the sobriquet it now generally receives, that of ‘John
Bull.’ Long ago, however, under the offensive title of
‘Jean Gotdam,’ we had become known as a people
given to strange and unpleasant oaths. It is interesting
to trace the way in which ‘William’ has again
recovered itself in later days. Throughout the Middle
Ages it occupied a sturdy second place, fearless of any
rival beyond the one that had supplanted it. Its dark
hour was the Puritan Commonwealth. As a Pagan
name it was rejected with horror and disdain. From
the day of the Protestant settlement and William’s
accession, however, it again looked up from the cold
shade into which it had fallen, and now once more
stands easily, as eight centuries ago, at the head of
our baptismal registers. ‘John,’ on the other hand,
though it had the advantage of being in no way hateful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>to the Puritan conscience, has, from one reason or
another, gone down in the world, and now has again
resumed its early place as second.</p>

<p class='c007'>The surnames that have descended to us from
‘William’ and ‘John’ are well-nigh numberless—far
too many for enumeration here. To begin with the
former, however, we find that the simple ‘Williams’
and ‘Williamson’ occupy whole pages of our directories.
Besides these, we have from the curter ‘Will,’
‘Wills,’ ‘Willis,’ and ‘Wilson;’ from the diminutive
‘Guillemot’ or ‘Gwillot,’ as it is often spelt in olden
records. ‘Gillot,’ ‘Gillott,’ and ‘Gillett;’ or from
‘Williamot,’<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c009'><sup>[29]</sup></a> the more English form of the same,
‘Willmot,’ ‘Wilmot,’ ‘Willot,’ ‘Willet,’ and ‘Willert.’
In conjunction with the pet addenda, we get ‘Wilks,’
‘Wilkins,’ and ‘Wilkinson,’ and ‘Wilcox,’ ‘Wilcocson,’
and ‘Wilcockson.’ Lastly, we have representatives of
the more corrupt forms in such names as ‘Weeks,’
‘Wickens,’ ‘Wickenson,’ and ‘Bill’ and ‘Bilson.’ Mr.
Lower, who does not quote any authority for the
statement, alleges that there was an old provincial
nickname for ‘William’—viz., ‘Till;’ whence ‘Tilson,’
‘Tillot,’ ‘Tillotson,’ and ‘Tilly.’ That these are sprung
from ‘Till’ is evident, but there can be no reasonable
doubt that this is but the still existing curtailment of
‘Matilda,’ which, as the most familiar female name of
that day, would originate many a family so entitled.
‘Tyllott Thompson’ is a name occurring in York in
1414. Thus it is to the Conqueror’s wife, and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>himself, these latter owe their rise. It is not the first
time a wife’s property has thus been rudely wrenched
from her for her husband’s benefit. The surnames
from ‘John’ are as multifarious as is possible in the
case of a monosyllable, ingenuity in the contraction
thereof being thus manifestly limited. As ‘John’
simple it is very rare; but this has been well atoned
for by ‘Jones,’ which, adding ‘John’ again as a prænomen,
would be (as has been well said by the
Registrar-General) in Wales a perpetual incognito,
and being proclaimed at the cross of a market town
would indicate no one in particular. Certainly ‘John
Jones,’ in the Principality, is but a living contradiction
to the purposes for which names and surnames came
into existence. Besides this, however, we have ‘Johnson’
and ‘Jonson,’ ‘Johncock’ and ‘Jenkins,’ ‘Jennings’
and ‘Jenkinson,’ ‘Jackson’ and ‘Jacox,’ and
‘Jenks;’ which latter, however, now bids fair, under
the patronage of ‘Ginx’s Baby,’ to be found for the
future in a new and more quaint dress than it has
hitherto worn. Besides several of the above, it is to
the Welsh, also, we owe our ‘Ivens,’ ‘Evans,’ and
‘Bevans’ (<i>i.e.</i> Ap-Evan), which are but sprung from
the same name. The Flemings, too, have not suffered
their form of it to die out for lack of support; for it is
with the settlement of ‘Hans,’<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c009'><sup>[30]</sup></a> a mere abbreviation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>of ‘Johannes,’ we are to date the rise of our familiar
‘Hansons,’ ‘Hankins,’ ‘Hankinsons,’ and ‘Hancocks,’
or ‘Handcocks.’ Nor is this all. ‘John’ enjoyed the
peculiar prerogative of being able to attach to itself
adjectives of a flattering, or at least harmless nature,
and issuing forth and becoming accepted by the world
therewith. Thus—though we shall have to notice it
again—from the praiseworthy effort to distinguish the
many ‘Johns’ each community possessed, we have
still in our midst such names as ‘Prujean’ and ‘Grosjean,’
‘Micklejohn’ and ‘Littlejohn,’ ‘Properjohn’
and ‘Brownjohn,’ and last, but not least, the estimable
‘Bonjohn.’ Do we need to go on to prove ‘Jack’s’
popularity, or rather universality?<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c009'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Every stranger
was ‘Jack’ till he was found to be somebody else; so
that ‘every man Jack of them’ has been a kind of
general lay-baptism for ages. Every young supernumerary,
whose position and age gave the licence,
was in the eye of his superiors simply ‘Jack.’ As one
instrument after another, however, was brought into
use, by which manual service was rendered unnecessary
and ‘Jack’ unneeded, instead of superannuating
him he was quietly thrust into the new
and inanimate office, and what with ‘boot-jacks’ and
‘black-jacks,’ ‘jack-towels’ and ‘smoke-jacks,’ ‘jacks’
for this and ‘jacks’ for that, no wonder people have
begun to speak unkindly of him as ‘Jack-of-all-trades
and master of none.’ Still, with this uncomplimentary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>tone, there was a smack of praise. A notion, at any
rate, got abroad that ‘Jack’ must be a knowing,
clever, sharp-witted sort of fellow, one who has his
eyes open. So we got into the way of associating
him with the more lively of the birds, beasts, and
fishes; such, for instance, as the ‘jack-daw,’ the ‘jack-an-apes,’
and the ‘jack-pike.’ But ‘familiarity,’ as
our copybooks long ago informed us, ‘breeds contempt;’
and so was it with ‘Jack’—he became a
mark for ridicule. Even in Chaucer’s day ‘jack-fool’
or ‘jack-pudding’ was the synonym for a buffoon, and
‘jackass’ for a dolt; and here it but nationalises the
‘zany,’ a corruption of the Italian ‘Giovanni,’ or
‘merry-John,’ corresponding to our ‘merry-Andrew.’
‘Jack of Dover’ also existed at the same period as a
cant term for a clever knave, and that it still lived in
the seventeenth century is clear from Taylor’s rhyme,
where he says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nor Jacke of Dover, that grand jury Jacke,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor Jack-sauce, the worst knave amongst the pack,</div>
      <div class='line'>But of the Jacke of Jackes, great Jack-a-Lent,</div>
      <div class='line'>To write his worthy acts is my intent.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c009'><sup>[32]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Altogether, we may claim for ‘John’ a prominent,
if not distinguished, position in the annals of English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>nomenclature. Nor must we forget ‘Joan,’ until
Tudor days the general form of the present ‘Jane.’
Then ‘some of the better and nicer sort,’ as Camden
saith, ‘misliking the former, turned it into “Jane”;’
and in testimony of this he adds that ‘Jane’ is never
found in older records. This is strictly true. There
can be little doubt that when the fair queen of Henry
VIII. gave distinction to the name it became a courtly
fashion to give it a different form from that borne by
the multitude, and thus ‘Jane’ arose. Thus ‘Joan’
was left, as Miss Yonge says, ‘to the cottage and the
kitchen;’ and there, indeed, it lingered on for a long
period.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c009'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Of many another could Shakespeare have
sung:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then nightly sings the staring owl,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>To-who.</div>
      <div class='line'>To-whit, to-who, a merry note,</div>
      <div class='line'>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Previously to this, anyway, both queens and princesses
had been content with ‘Joan.’ I doubt not,
with regard to several of the surnames above-mentioned,
‘John’ must, if the truth be told, share the
honours of origination with ‘Joan;’ nor do I think
‘Jennison’ peculiar to the latter. What with ‘John’
and ‘Jean’ for the masculine, and ‘Joan’ and ‘Jenny’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>for the feminine, I do not see how the two could
possibly escape confusion. ‘Jones’ and ‘Joanes,’ and
‘Jane’ and ‘Jayne,’ to say nothing of ‘Jennings,’
seem as like hereditary from the one as the other.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c009'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
Two feminines from ‘Jack,’ viz. ‘Jacquetta’ and
‘Jacqueline,’ were not unknown in England; ‘Jacquetta
Knokyn’ (AA 3), ‘Jackett Toser’ (Z). The
latter was the more common, and bequeathed us a
surname ‘Jacklin,’ which still exists. It is found on
an old bell:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This bell was broke and cast againe, as plainly doth appeare,</div>
      <div class='line'>John Draper made me in 1618, wich tyme churchwardens were,</div>
      <div class='line'>Edward Dixson for the one, who stood close to his tacklin,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he that was his partner there was Alexander Jacklin.</div>
      <div class='c021'>(<i>Book of Days</i>, i. 303.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The peasant’s leather jerkin, corresponding to the more
lordly coat of mail, was a <i>jack</i> whence the diminutive
<i>jacket</i>. The more warlike dress gave rise to the
name of ‘Jackman,’ of which more anon.</p>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The Angevine dynasty gave a new impulse to
some already popular names, and may be said in
reality to have introduced, although not altogether
unknown, several new ones. The two which owe the
security of their establishment to it are ‘Geoffrey’
and ‘Fulke.’ The grandfather, the father, a brother,
and a son of Henry II. were ‘Geoffrey;’ and still
earlier than this, ‘Geoffrey Grisegonelle,’ ‘Geoffrey
Martel,’ and ‘Geoffrey Barbu’ had each in turn set
their mark upon the same. Apart from these influences,
too, the stories brought home by the Crusaders
of the prowess of Godfrey, the conqueror of
Jerusalem, must have had their wonted effect in a
day of such martial renown. Such surnames as
‘Jeffs,’ ‘Jeffries,’ ‘Jefferson,’ ‘Jeffcock,’ ‘Jeffkins,’
‘Jephson,’ and ‘Jepson’ still record the share it had
obtained in English esteem. ‘Fulke,’ or ‘Fulque,’
though there had been six so early as Domesday
Book, when it came backed as it was by the fact of
having given title to five Angevine rulers, got an inevitable
place. Few Christian names were so common
as this in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.
But it was an ungainly one, difficult to pronounce,
and difficult to form into a patronymic. Thus, ‘Faxson’
and ‘Fawson’ are the only longer forms I can
find as at present existing, while the variously spelt
‘Fulkes,’ ‘Foulkes,’ ‘Fakes,’ ‘Faux,’ ‘Fawkes,’
‘Faulks,’ ‘Fowkes,’ ‘Folkes,’ ‘Foakes,’ and doubtless
sometimes ‘Fox,’ serve to show how hard it was to
hand it down in its original integrity. The entries
in our mediæval registers are equally varied. We
light upon such people as ‘Fowlke Grevill,’ ‘Fowke
Crompton,’ ‘Fulk Paifrer,’ ‘Fulke le Taverner,’ ‘Foke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Odell,’ ‘Faukes le Buteller,’ ‘Nel Faukes,’ and ‘John
Faux.’ As an English historic name it has given us
two miscreants; the hateful favourite of John, outlawed
by Henry III., and the still more sanguinary
villain of James I.’s day, in whose dishonour we still
pile up the blazing logs in the gloomy nights of
November. Henry, again, or more properly speaking
Harry, owes much to the Plantagenets, for but three
are to be found in Domesday. With its long line
of monarchs, albeit it represented a curious mixture
of good, bad, and indifferent qualities, that dynasty
could not but stamp itself decisively on our registers.
Thus, we have still plenty of ‘Henrys,’ ‘Harrises,’
‘Harrisons,’ ‘Hallets,’ ‘Halkets,’ ‘Hawkinses,’ and
‘Hawkinsons;’ to say nothing of the Welsh ‘Parrys’
and ‘Penrys.’<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c009'><sup>[35]</sup></a> (‘Thomas Ap-Harry,’ D. ‘Hugh Ap-harrye,’
Z.) The Norman diminutive was early used,
as such folk as ‘Alicia Henriot,’ ‘Robert Henriot,’
‘Heriot Heringflet,’ ‘Thomas Haryette,’ or ‘William
Haryott’ could have borne witness. ‘Harriot,’ or
‘Harriet,’ has been revived in recent days as a feminine
baptismal name. ‘Hawkin,’ or ‘Halkin,’<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c009'><sup>[36]</sup></a> however,
was perhaps the most popular form. Langland
represents Conscience as saying:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thi beste cote, Haukyn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath manye moles and spottes,</div>
      <div class='line'>It moste ben y-wasshe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Baldwin had already appeared at the Conquest, for
an aunt of William’s had married Baldwin, Earl of
Flanders, and he himself was espoused to Matilda,
daughter of the fifth ‘Baldwin’ of that earldom. No
doubt the Flemings brought in fresh accessions, and
when we add to this the fact of its being by no means
an unpopular Angevine name, we can readily see why
‘Balderson,’ ‘Bolderson,’ ‘Balcock,’ ‘Bodkin,’ and the
simple ‘Baldwin,’ have maintained a quiet but steady
position in the English lists ever since. Thus, the
Plantagenets are not without memorials, even in the
nineteenth century.</p>
<h3 class='c020'>III.—<i>Names from the Calendar of the Saints.</i></h3>
<p class='c018'>It is to Norman influence we owe the firm establishment
of several names, which had already got
securely settled on the Continent on account of the
odour of sanctity that had gathered about them. The
Reformation threw into the shade of oblivion the
memories of many holy men and women who in their
day and generation exercised a powerful influence on
our general nomenclature. Many of my readers will
be unaware that there were three St. Geralds and
three St. Gerards held in high repute previous to the
eleventh century. The higher Norman families seem
to have been attached to both, though ‘Gerard’ has
made the deepest impression. ‘Gerald’ and ‘Fitz-Gerald’
are the commonest descendants of the first.
As respects ‘Gerard,’ such names as ‘Garret Widdrington,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>or ‘Jarrarde Hall,’ or ‘Jarat Nycholson,’
found among our Yorkshire entries, serve to show
how far the spirit of verbal corruption can advance;
and our many ‘Garrets,’ ‘Jarrets,’ ‘Jarratts,’ and
‘Jerards,’ as surnames, will probably testify the same
to all ages.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c009'><sup>[37]</sup></a> As there were twenty-eight ‘Walters’
in Domesday Survey, we cannot attribute the popularity
of that name to St. Walter, abbot of Fontenelle
in the middle of the twelfth century. But, as Miss
Yonge shows, it had been spread over Aquitaine in
the earlier part of the tenth century, through the
celebrity of a saintly Walter who resided in that
dukedom about the year 990. Few sobriquets enjoyed
such a share of attention as this. In one of its
nicknames, that of ‘Water,’<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c009'><sup>[38]</sup></a> we are reminded of
Suffolk’s death in Shakespeare’s <i>Henry VI.</i>, where
the murderer says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>My name is Walter Whitmore.</div>
      <div class='line'>How now! why start’st thou? What, doth death affright!</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Suffolk.</i> Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.</div>
      <div class='line'>A cunning man did calculate my birth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And told me that by <i>water</i> I should die.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>University men will remember a play of another kind
upon its other form of ‘Wat,’ in the poems of C. S. C.,
whose power of rhyming, at least, I have never seen
surpassed, even by Ingoldsby himself. He thus
begins one of his happiest efforts—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Ere the morn the east has crimsoned,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When the stars are twinkling there,</div>
      <div class='line'>(As they did in Watts’s Hymns, and</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Made him wonder what they were.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This, too, it will be seen, as well as ‘Water,’ still
abides with us in its own or an extended guise, for
our ‘Watts’ and ‘Waters,’ ‘Watsons’ and ‘Watersons,’
‘Watkins’ and ‘Watkinsons,’ would muster
strongly if in conclave assembled. Our ‘Waltrots,’
though not so numerous, are but the ancient ‘Walterot.’
As a Christian name Walter stands low now-a-days.
‘Tonkin,’ ‘Tonson,’ and ‘Townson’ (found in
such an entry as ‘Jane Tounson’) remind us of
‘Anthony,’<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c009'><sup>[39]</sup></a> a name previous to the Reformation
popular as that possessed by the great ascetic of the
fourth century. A curious phrase got connected with
St. Anthony, that of ‘tantony-pig.’ It is said that
monks attached to monasteries dedicated to this saint
had the privilege of allowing their swine to feed in
the streets. These habitually following those who
were wont to offer greens to them, gave rise to the
expression, ‘To follow like a Tantony-pig.’ Thus, in
‘The good wyfe wold a pylgremage,’ it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When I am out of the towne,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Look that thou be wyse,</div>
      <div class='line'>And run thou not from hous to hous,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like a nantyny grice.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The connection between St. Anthony and swine,
which gave the good monks this benefit, seems, in
spite of many wild guesses, to have arisen from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>mere fact of his dwelling so long in the woodlands.
As Barnabe Googe has it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The bristled hogges doth Antonie</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Preserve and cherish well,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who in his lifetime always did</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In woodes and forestes dwell.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c009'><sup>[40]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It must have been this connexion which made ‘Tony’
the common sobriquet for a simpleton or a country
clown. It lived in this sense till Dryden’s day, and
certainly had become such so early as the thirteenth
century, if we may judge by the occurrence of such
names as ‘Ida le Tony,’ or ‘Roger le Tony,’ found in
the Rolls of that period.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c009'><sup>[41]</sup></a> If, however, St. Anthony
was thus doomed to be an example, how great may
be the drawbacks to saintly distinction: ‘St. Cuthbert,’
who, in the odour of sanctity, dwelt at Lindisfarne,
may even be more pitied, for, owing to the
familiarity of his name in every rustic household of
Northumbria and Durham, he became as ‘Cuddie,’ a
sobriquet for the donkey, and is thus known and
associated to the present moment. Our ‘Cuthberts,’
‘Cuthbertsons,’ and ‘Cutbeards,’ however, need trouble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>themselves little, I imagine, on the question of their
connection with the animal to whom we usually
ascribe the honours in regard to obstinacy and stubbornness.
Our ‘Cuddies,’ perhaps, are not quite so
free from suspicion. Our ‘Cobbets’ undoubtedly
spring from ‘Cuthbert.’ A ‘Nicholas Cowbeytson’
occurs in a Yorkshire register of the fourteenth century
(Fabric Rolls of York Minster: Sur. Soc.). From
‘Cowbeyt’ to ‘Cobbet’ is a natural—I might say an
inevitable—change. This name, however, owes nothing
to the Normans. Not so ‘Giles.’ Everyone
knows the story of St. Giles, how he dwelt as an
anchorite in the forest near Nismes, and was discovered
by the King because the hind, which daily gave
him milk, pushed in the chase, fled to his feet. The
name is entered in our rolls alike as ‘Giles,’ ‘Gile,’
and ‘Egedius’ (Gile Deacon. A. Jordan fil. Egidius,
A). St. Lawrence, put on a gridiron over a slow fire in
the third century, made his name popular in Spain.
An archbishop of Canterbury, raised to a saintship
in the seventh century, made the same familiar in
England. Besides ‘Lawson,’ we have ‘Larkins’ and
‘Larson.’ In the lines already quoted relative to Wat
Tyler’s insurrection, it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Larkin</i> et in medio, non minor esse putat.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The French diminutive occurs also. An ‘Andrew
Larrett’ is mentioned by Nicholls in his history of
Leicestershire, and the surname may still be seen in
our directories. ‘Lambert’ received a large accession
in England through the Flemings, who thus preserved
a memorial of the patron of Liege, St. Lambert, who
was martyred early in the eighth century. Succumbing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>to the fashion so prevalent among the
Flemings, it is generally found as ‘Lambkin,’ such
entries as ‘Lambekyn fil. Eli’ or ‘Lambekin Taborer’
being common. The present surnominal forms are
‘Lambert,’ ‘Lampson,’<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c009'><sup>[42]</sup></a> ‘Lambkin,’ and ‘Lampkin.’
Thus our ‘Lambkins’ cannot boast of the Moses-like
disposition of their ancestor on philological grounds.
With the mention of three other saints we conclude
this list. The legend of St. Christopher had its due
effect on the popular taste, and it is early found in
the various guises of ‘Cristophre,’ ‘Cristofer,’ and
‘Christofer.’ ‘Christophers’ and ‘Christopherson’ represent
the surnames of the fuller form. To the pet
form we owe our ‘Kitts’ and ‘Kitsons.’ St. Christopher’s
Isle in the West Indies is now familiarly St.
Kitts. It was of the indignity offered to Christopher
Marlowe’s genius in calling him so generally by this
brief sobriquet that Heywood spoke when he said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Marlowe, renowned for his rare art and wit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could ne’er attain beyond the name of Kit.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c009'><sup>[43]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The same writer has it also in one of his epigrams—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nothing is lighter than a feather, Kytte,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes, Climme: what light thing is that? thy light wytte.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We have already mentioned one abbot of Fontenelle
who influenced our nomenclature. Another who
exerted a similar power was ‘St. Gilbert,’ a contemporary
and friend of the Conqueror. A few generations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>afterwards brought the English St. Gilbert to
the fore, and then the name began to grow common,
so common that as ‘Gib’ it became the favourite
sobriquet of the feline species.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c009'><sup>[44]</sup></a> In several of our
earliest writers it is found in familiar use, and in the
Bard of Avon’s day it was not forgotten. Falstaff
complains of being as melancholy as a ‘gib-cat’—that
is, an old worn-out cat. Hamlet also says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such dear concernings hide? (iii. 4.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘To play the gib’ was a proverbial phrase for light
and wanton behaviour.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c009'><sup>[45]</sup></a> Thus ‘Gilbert’ has been
forced into a somewhat unpleasant notoriety in feline
nomenclature. But he was popular enough, too,
among the human kind. In that part of the ‘Townley
Mysteries’ which represents the Nativity, one of
the shepherds is supposed to hail one of his friends,
who is passing by. He addresses him thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How, Gyb, good morne, wheder goys thou?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>The surnames formed from Gilbert, too, prove his
popularity. Beside ‘Gilbert’ himself, we have
‘Gibbs,’ ‘Gibbins,’ ‘Gibbons,’ ‘Gibson,’<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c009'><sup>[46]</sup></a> ‘Gibbonson,’
and ‘Gipps,’ to say nothing of that famous citizen of
credit and renown, ‘John Gilpin,’ who has immortalized
at least his setting of this good old-fashioned
name.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having referred to Gilbert and Gib the cat, we must
needs notice ‘Theobald’ and ‘Tib.’ ‘St. Theobald,’ if
he has not himself given much prominence to the title,
nevertheless represents a name whose susceptibility to
change was something amazing. The common form
with the French was ‘Thibault’ or ‘Thibaud,’ and
this is represented in England in such entries as
‘Tebald de Engleschevile,’ ‘Richard Tebaud,’ or
‘Roger Tebbott.’ A still curter form was ‘Tibbe’ or
‘Tebbe;’ hence such registrations as ‘Tebbe Molendinarius’
or ‘Tebb fil. William.’ In this dress it is
found in the Latin lines commemorative of Tyler’s
insurrection:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Hudde</i> ferit, quem <i>Judde</i> terit, dum <i>Tibbe</i> juvatur,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Jacke</i> domosque viros vellit, en ense necat.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Among other surnames that speak for its faded popularity
are ‘Tibbes,’ ‘Tebbes,’ and ‘Tubbs,’ ‘Theobald’
and ‘Tibbald,’ ‘Tibble’ and ‘Tipple,’ ‘Tipkins’ and
‘Tippins,’ and ‘Tipson,’ and our endlessly varied
‘Tibbats,’ ‘Tibbets,’ ‘Tibbits,’ ‘Tebbatts,’ ‘Tebbotts,’
and ‘Tebbutts.’ Indeed, the name has simply run
riot among the vowels. ‘Hugh’ I have kept till the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>last, because of its important position as an early
name. It was crowded with holy associations. There
was a ‘St. Hugh,’ Abbot of Cluny, in 1109. There
was a ‘St. Hugh,’ Bishop of Grenoble, in 1132.
There was ‘St. Hugh,’ Bishop of Lincoln, in 1200,
and above all there was the celebrated infant martyr,
‘St. Hugh,’ of Lincoln, said to have been crucified by
the Jews of that city in 1250. This event happened
just at the best time for affecting our surnames. Their
hereditary tendency was becoming marked. Thus it
is that ‘Hugh,’ or ‘Hew,’<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c009'><sup>[47]</sup></a> as it was generally spelt,
has made such an indenture upon our nomenclature.
The pet forms are all Norman-French, the most
popular being ‘Huet,’ ‘Hugon,’ and ‘Huelot,’ the
last formed like ‘Hamelot,’ and ‘Hobelot.’ The
second of these was further corrupted by the English
into ‘Hutchin’ and ‘Huggin.’<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c009'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Hence our rolls teem
with such registrations as ‘Hewe Hare,’ ‘Huet de
Badone,’ ‘William fil. Hugonis,’ ‘Houlot de Manchester,’
‘Walter Hughelot,’ ‘John Hewisson,’ ‘Simon
Howissone,’ ‘Roger fil. Hulot,’ or ‘Alan Huchyns.’
Among the surnames still common in our directories
may be numbered ‘Huggins,’ ‘Hutchins,’ ‘Hutchinson,’
‘Hugginson,’ ‘Howlett,’ ‘Hullett,’ ‘Hewlett,’
‘Huet,’ ‘Hewet,’ ‘Hewetson,’ ‘Howett,’ ‘Howson,’
‘Hughes,’ and ‘Hewson.’ All these various forms
bespeak a familiarity which is now of course utterly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>wanting, so far as our Christian nomenclature is concerned.
Indeed, after all I have said, I still feel that
it is impossible to give the reader an adequate conception
of the popularity of this name four hundred
years ago. It is one more conspicuous instance
marking the change which the Reformation and an
English Bible effected upon our nomenclature.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>IV.—<i>Names chosen from Festivals and Holydays.</i></h3>

<p class='c018'>We may here refer to a group of appellatives
which are derived from the names of certain days and
seasons. I dare not say that all I shall mention are
absolutely sprung from one and the same custom.
Some, I doubt not, were bestowed upon their owners
from various accidental circumstances of homely and
individual interest. Neighbours would readily affix
a nickname of this class upon one who had by some
creditable or mean action made a particular season
remarkable in his personal history. But these, I presume,
will be exceptional, for there is no manner of
doubt that it was a practice, and by no means a rare
one, to baptize a child by the name of the day on
which it was born, especially if it were a holiday. We
know now how often it happens that the Church
Calendar furnishes names for those born upon the
Saints’ days—how many ‘Johns’ and ‘Jameses’ and
‘Matthews’ owe their appellations to the fact that
they came into the world upon the day marked,
ecclesiastically, for the commemoration of those particular
Apostles. This is still a custom among more
rigid Churchmen. In early days, however, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>carried to an extreme extent. Days of a simply
local interest—days for fairs and wakes—days that
were celebrated in the civil calendar—days that were
the boundaries of the different seasons—all were
familiarly pressed into the service of name-giving.
These, springing up in a day when they were no
sooner made part of the personal than they became
candidates for our hereditary nomenclature, have in
many cases come down to us. Thus, the time when
the yule log blazed and crackled on the hearth has
given us ‘Christmas,’ or ‘Noel,’ or ‘Yule,’ or ‘Midwinter.’
This last seems to have been an ordinary
term for the day, for we find it in colloquial use at
this time. In Robert of Gloucester’s ‘Life of William
the Conqueror,’ he speaks of it’s being his intention</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>to Midwinter at Gloucester,</div>
      <div class='line'>To Witesontid at Westminster, to Ester at Wincester.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Pentecost’ was as familiar a term in the common
mouth as ‘Whitsuntide,’ and thus we find both occurring
in the manner mentioned. ‘Wytesunday’ is, however,
now obsolete; ‘Pentecost’ still lives.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c009'><sup>[49]</sup></a> ‘Paske,’
for ‘Easter,’ was among the priesthood the word in
general use; old writers always speak of ‘Paske’
for that solemn season. Thus, ‘Pask,’ ‘Pash,’ ‘Paschal,’
and ‘Pascal’<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c009'><sup>[50]</sup></a> are firmly set in our directories;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>as, indeed, they are on the Continent also. It is the
same with ‘Lammas,’ ‘Sumption,’ and ‘Middlemas;’
that is, ‘Assumption’ and ‘Michaelmas.’ Each as it
came round imprinted its name at the baptismal font
upon the ancestors of all those who still bear these
several titles in our midst. It would be an anachronism,
therefore, to suppose Mr. Robinson Crusoe to
have been the first who introduced this system, as
even ‘Friday’ itself, to say nothing of ‘Munday,’ or
‘Monday,’ and ‘Saturday,’ and ‘Tuesday,’ were all
surnames long anterior to that notable personage’s
existence. Nor, as I have said, are the less solemn
feast days disregarded. ‘Loveday’ is one such proof.
In olden times there was often a day fixed for the
arrangement of differences, in which, if possible, old
sores were to be healed up and old-standing accounts
settled. This day, called a ‘Loveday,’ is frequently
alluded to. That very inconsistent friar in Piers
Plowman’s Vision could, it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>hold lovedays,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hear a reves rekenyng.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The latter part of the quotation suggests to us the
origin of ‘Termday,’ which I find as existing in the
twelfth century, and probably given in the humorous
spirit of that day.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c009'><sup>[51]</sup></a> Nor are these all. ‘Plouday’ was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the first Monday after Twelfth Night, and the day on
which the farmer began his ploughing. It was a great
rural holiday at one time, and the ploughmen as a rule
got gloriously drunk. Similarly, we have ‘Hockerday,’
‘Hockday,’ and perhaps the still more corrupted
‘Hobday,’ the old English expression for a ‘high-day.’
The second Tuesday after Easter was especially so
termed, and kept in early times as such, as commemorative
of the driving out of the Danes in the days of
Ethelred. This was a likely name to be given on
such a high day in the domestic annals as that on
which the first-born came into the world. Happy
parents would readily seize upon this at a time when
the word and its meaning were alike familiar. Our
‘Hallidays’ or ‘Hollidays’ throw us back to the
Church festivals, those times of merriment and jollity
which have helped to such a degree to dissociate from
our minds the real meaning of the word (that is, a
day set apart for holy service in commemoration of
some religious event), that we have now been compelled
by a varied spelling to make the distinction
between a ‘holyday’ and a ‘holiday.’ Thus strongly
marked upon our nomenclature is this once favourite
but now well-nigh obsolete custom.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>V.—<i>Patronymics formed from Occupations.</i></h3>

<p class='c018'>We may here briefly refer to a class of patronymics
which, although small from the first, took its place,
as if insensibly, among our hereditary surnames. It
is a class of <i>occupative</i> or <i>professional</i> names, with the
filial desinence attached. There is nothing wonderful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>in the fact of the existence of such. The wonder is
that there are not more of them. It must have been
all but as natural to style a man as the son of ‘the
Clerk’ as the son of ‘Harry’ in a small community,
where the father had, in his professional capacity,
established himself as of some local importance.
Hence we cannot be surprised to find ‘Clerkson’ in
our registers. It is thus the ‘sergeant’ has bequeathed
us our ‘Sergeantsons;’ the ‘kemp,’ or soldier, our
‘Kempsons;’ the ‘cook,’ our ‘Cooksons,’ or ‘Filius
Coci,’ as the Hundred Rolls have it; the ‘smith,’ our
‘Smithsons;’ the ‘steward,’ our ‘Stewardsons;’ the
‘grieve,’ <i>i.e.</i> ‘reeve,’ our ‘Grievesons;’ the ‘miller,’ our
‘Millersons;’ and the ‘shepherd,’ our ‘Shepherdsons.’
Of other instances, now obsolete, we had ‘Masterson,’
‘Hyneson,’<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c009'><sup>[52]</sup></a> ‘Hopperson,’ ‘Scolardson,’ and ‘Priestson.’
Nor were the Normans without traces of this
practice, although in their case all the examples I
have met with have ceased to exist amongst us.
‘Fitz-Clerk’ but corresponds with one of the above;
while the warden of the woods gave us ‘Fitz-Parker,’
and that of the college, ‘Fitz-Provost.’ Thus, those
who yet possess names of this class may congratulate
themselves upon belonging to a small but compact
body which has ever existed amid our more general
nomenclature.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>VI.—<i>Metronymics.</i></h3>

<p class='c018'>We have already mentioned Joan as having bequeathed
several surnames. We did not then allude
to the somewhat difficult subject of metronymics;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>we shall first prove by examples that there are a
large number of such. We shall then briefly unfold
their origin from our point of view. The feminine of
Peter, ‘Petronilla,’ was a name in familiar use at this
time. St. Petronilla, once much besought as a help
against fevers, would no doubt add to its popularity.
Barnyby Googe says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The quartane ague and the rest</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Doth Pernel take away,</div>
      <div class='line'>And John preserves his worshippers</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From prison every day.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the above stanza we are supplied with the common
sobriquet taken from his name. As ‘Pernel’ or
‘Parnel’ it held a high place among the poorer classes.
From an ill-repute, however, that attached to it in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it is now all
but extinct as a Christian name, and it is only among
our surnames that it is to be met with. It is curious
how associations of this kind destroy the chances of
popularity among names. ‘Peter’ was forced into
familiarity. ‘Pernel’ lost caste through its becoming
a cant term for women of a certain character.
‘Magdalen’ is another case in point. The Bible narrative
describes her briefly as a penitent sinner. Legend,
adding to this, portrayed her beauty, her golden
tresses, her rich drapery. Art added touches of its
own in the shape of dishevelled hair and swelled eyes,
but all to make this centre scene of penitence the more
marked. This, and the early asylums for penitents, of
which she became the forced patroness, prevented her
name being used as a Christian name at this time—I
have never, at least, found an instance. But as a
proof how early it had become a term for what I may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>call mental inebriety, a connection which of course it
owes to the portrayals alluded to above, I may instance
the name of Thomas le Maddelyn, found in the
twelfth century (H.R.), and an evident nickname
given to one of a sickly sentimental character. Our
present ‘Maudlins’ and ‘Maudlings’ may be descended
from one so entitled, or locally from some
place dedicated to the saint.</p>
<p class='c007'>Among other female names, ‘Constance’ bid fair
to become very popular. A daughter of William the
Conqueror, a daughter of Stephen, and a daughter-in-law
of Henry II. were all so called. Chaucer in
his ‘Man of Lawes Tale’ calls his heroine by this
title—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But Hermegild loved Custance as her life,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Custance hath so long sojourned there</div>
      <div class='line'>In orisons, with many a bitter tear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Til Jesu hath converted, through his grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dame Hermegild.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This must have been its favourite form in the common
mouth, for we find it recorded in such names as
‘Custance Muscel,’ ‘Custance Clerk,’ ‘Robert fil.
Custe,’ or ‘Cus nepta Johannis,’ with tolerable frequency.
The diminutive ‘Cussot’ is also to be met
with. I need hardly say that in our ‘Custances,’
‘Custersons,’ ‘Cuss’s,’ and ‘Custs,’ not to say some of
our ‘Cousens,’ as corruptions of ‘Custson,’ the remembrance
of this once familiar name still survives.
Of late years the name proper has again become
popular. ‘Beatrice’ is another instance of a name
once common sunk into comparative desuetude. The
Norman ‘Beton’ was the most favoured pet form.
Piers Plowman says (Passus V.):—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Beton the Brewestere bade him good-morrow,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and a little further on,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And bade Bette cut a bough, and beat Betoun therewith.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus it is we frequently light upon such entries as
‘John Betyn,’ ‘Betin de Friscobald,’ ‘Robert Betonson,’
‘John Bettenson,’ or ‘Thomas Betanson.’ These
latter of course soon dropped into ‘Beatson’ and
‘Betson,’ which, with ‘Beton’ and ‘Beaton,’ are still
common to our directories. ‘Emma,’ too, as a Norman
name has left its mark. By a pure accident,
however, as Miss Yonge points out, it had got a place
previous to the Conquest among the Saxons, through
the fact of the daughter of Richard I. of Normandy
marrying first Ethelred, surnamed the Unready, and
then Canute the Great. Thus, though it has not unfrequently
been claimed as of Saxon origin, it is not
so in reality. The general spelling is ‘Emme,’ and
the pet ‘Emmot’ or ‘Emmet’ is found in such names
as ‘Emmota Plummer’ or ‘Emmetta Catton.’ This
at once guides us into the source of our ‘Emmots,’
‘Emmetts,’<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c009'><sup>[53]</sup></a> ‘Emmes,’ ‘Emsons,’ ‘Empsons,’ and
‘Emmotsons.’<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c009'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Almost as equal a favourite as ‘Emma’ was
‘Cecilia.’ This was a name introduced at the Conquest
in the person of Cecile, a daughter of William I.,
and it soon found itself a favourite among high and
low as ‘Cicely,’ or still shorter as ‘Cis’ or ‘Sis,’ although
the latter seems to have been the more general
form. In Piers Plowman, however, is preserved the
more correct initial. I have already quoted him when
he speaks so familiarly of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Cesse the souteresse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In all the ballads of the seventeenth century, on the
other hand, it is always ‘Sis,’ ‘Siss’ or ‘Sys.’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Sissons,’ ‘Sysons,’ and ‘Sisselsons’<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c009'><sup>[55]</sup></a> are of
course but the offspring of this pretty appellative,
while one more instance of the popular diminutive
may be met with in such a name as ‘John Sissotson’
or ‘Cissota West’ found in the ‘Testamenta Eboracensia,’
or ‘Bella Cesselot’ in the Hundred Rolls.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c009'><sup>[56]</sup></a>
Our ‘Dowses,’ ‘Dossons,’ and ‘Dowsons’ represent
the once popular ‘Douce,’ ‘Duce,’ or ‘Dulce,’ more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>correctly ‘Dulcia.’ Hence we find such entries as
‘John filius Dousæ,’ ‘Douce de Moster,’ and ‘John
Dowsson.’ Diminutives are found in ‘Richard Dowkin’
(F), and in ‘Dowsett,’ ‘Doucett,’ and ‘Duckett.’
The Norman was the more familiar form, all the more
so perhaps because in the baronial kitchen a course
of sweets was called <i>dowcetts</i>. An instance will be
found in the Rutland papers, p. 97 (Cam. Soc.). This
is but another form of our ‘dulcet.’ That the more
literal form was not lost, such names as ‘Dulcia le
Draper’ or ‘Dulcia fil. William’ will show, not to
mention our still existing patronymic ‘Dulson.’ The
later ‘Dulcibella’ underwent the same change and
became ‘Dowsabell.’ This also attained the rank of a
surname, for beside such entries as ‘Dowzable Mill’
(Z) and ‘Dussabel Caplyn’ (Z) we light upon a
‘Thomas Duszabell’ (M). Thus familiar was ‘Dulcia’
in former days. ‘Dionisia del Lee’ or ‘Dionisius
Garston’ are common entries, both masculine and
feminine forms being popular. ‘Dennis,’ ‘Denot,’
and ‘Dyot’ were the pet forms. Piers Plowman
styles one of his characters ‘Denot.’ Hereditary forms
are found in ‘Dennis,’ ‘Dennison,’ ‘Dyott,’ ‘Diotson,’<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c009'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
and ‘Dyson.’ I cannot but think that ‘Tenison’ or
‘Tennyson’ is but a corruption of ‘Dennison,’ as also
‘Tyson’ of ‘Dyson.’ That they are patronymics of
Antony (Tony) is the only alternative, and this I fear
is unsatisfactory. Mabel, although now somewhat out
of fashion, was very popular four hundred years ago
as ‘Amabilla,’ hence such entries as ‘Amabella la
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Blund,’ or ‘Amabil fil. Emme.’ The surnames descended
from it are sufficiently numerous to testify to
this. Besides ‘Mabell’ simple, we have ‘Mabson,’
‘Mabbs,’ ‘Mabbes,’ ‘Mabbott,’ and perhaps ‘Mapleson.’<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c009'><sup>[58]</sup></a>
Catharine, always called ‘Catlin’ in the North,
reminding us of the Irish ‘Kathleen,’ is the source of
several surnames. Entries like ‘Eleonore Catlynson’
(W. 12) or ‘Thomas Katlynson’ (W. 11) are common,
and the shorter ‘Cattlin’ is found in every Yorkshire
roll.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a certain quaint prettiness about ‘Hilary,’
‘Lettice,’ and ‘Joyce,’ three acceptable cognomens in
mediæval times. The Normans liked their women to
be, however modest, none the less lighthearted, gay,
and spirited, and in the synonyms of ‘mirth,’ ‘gladness,’
and ‘sportiveness,’ they would delight in affixing
on their newly-born children that which they hoped
would be in the future but the index of the real character.
‘Hillary’ when not local is therefore but the
fuller ‘Hilaria.’ ‘Joyce,’ sometimes the result of the
mere nickname, is nothing more than ‘Jocosa,’ and
‘Lettice,’ ‘Letts,’ and ‘Letson’ are sufficiently numerous
to preserve the memory of ‘Lætitia.’ Thus, in
one of the Coventry Mysteries already alluded to,
mention is made of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Col Crane and Davy Dry-dust,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Letson’ is met in the fourteenth century as ‘Fitz-Lettice.’
‘Theophania’ was anything but unpopular,
but its length made it unavoidable but that it should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>be mutilated, or at least put in an abbreviated or nickname
form, and thus it is has arisen our ‘Tiffany,’
whence of course the surname of to-day. Thus, in
the Coventry Mysteries, it is demanded that</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thierry in his history of the ‘Conquest of England’
quotes an old writer, who has preserved the following
lines of a decidedly doggrel character:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>William de Cognisby</div>
      <div class='line'>Came out of Brittany</div>
      <div class='line'>With his wife Tiffany,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his maid Manfras,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his dogge Hardigras.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>We must not forget to mention ‘Eleanor,’ or
‘Alianora,’ as it is more frequently registered, a
name of suffering royalty, and therefore to a portion
of the English people, at least, a popular name. Its
forms are too many for enumeration, but ‘Alianor,’
‘Annora,’ ‘Annot,’ ‘Alinot,’ ‘Leonora,’ ‘Eleanor,’
‘Elinor,’ ‘Ellen,’ ‘Lina,’ ‘Linot,’ and ‘Nel’ were the
most common. All of these were either surnames
themselves, or became the roots of surnames. Thus we
find among other entries such registrations as ‘Alicia
Alianor,’ ‘Alianor Busche,’ ‘Annora Widow,’ ‘Annora
de Aencurt,’ ‘Anota Canun,’ ‘John Annotson,’ ‘William
Annotyson,’ ‘Hugh fil. Elyenore,’ ‘William Alinot,’
‘Alnot Red,’ ‘Lyna le Archer,’ ‘Linota ate Field,’ or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>‘Linota Vidua.’ This list will suffice to prove the
place occupied by ‘Eleanor.’ I have not mentioned
such entries as ‘John fil. Nel’ or ‘Elisha Annyson,’
or ‘Richard Anyson,’ for though in these particular
instances we see the origin of some of our ‘Ansons’
and ‘Nelsons,’ both are more generally referable to a
different source. ‘Neal’ or ‘Neile’ was very common
in this day, and ‘Neilson’ would easily be corrupted
into ‘Nelson.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Julian,’ the abbreviated form of ‘Juliana,’ as a Norman-introduced
name became very popular, and its
after history was a very curious one. Such appellations
as ‘Gillian Cook,’ or ‘Gilian of the Mill,’ found
in the Hundred Rolls, or that of the well-known
‘Dame Julyan Berners,’ whose work on household
management I shall have occasion to quote by-and-by,
only represent in fuller forms the ‘Gill’ or ‘Jill’
who is so renowned in our nursery literature as having
met with such a dire disaster in the dutiful endeavour
‘to fetch a pail of water’ from the hill-side. I have
already mentioned ‘Cocke Lorell’s Bote,’ where allusion
is made to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Jelyan Joly at signe of the Bokeler.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The shorter and curter form is given us in Heywood’s
Epigrams, where the following marital dialogue occurs:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I am care-full to see thee carelesse, Jylle:</div>
      <div class='line'>I am wofull to see thee wytlesse, Wyll:</div>
      <div class='line'>I am anguisht to see thee an ape, Jyll:</div>
      <div class='line'>I am angry to see thee an asse, Wyll:</div>
      <div class='line'>I am dumpyshe to see thee play the drabbe, Jyll:</div>
      <div class='line'>I am knappyshe to see thee plaie the knave, Wyll.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>But ‘Gill’ at some time or other got into evil odour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and this brought the name into all but absolute disuse.
As a term for a wanton flirt or inconstant girl,
it was familiarly used till the eighteenth century. It
would seem as if the poet I have just quoted were
referring to this characteristic when he writes:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>All shall be well, Jacke shall have Gill;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, nay, Gill is wedded to Wyll;<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c009'><sup>[60]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>or where in another place he says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How may I have thee, Gill, when I wish for thee?</div>
      <div class='line'>Wish not for me Jack, but when thou mayest have me.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c009'><sup>[61]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The diminutive ‘Gilot’ or ‘Juliet’ is used in the same
way. In an old metrical sermon it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Robin will Gilot</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Leden to the nale,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sitten there togedres,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And tellen their tale.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This at once reminds us of the origin of our ‘jilt,’
which is nothing more than a relic of the name for
inconstancy the sobriquet had obtained. In our ‘Gills,’
‘Gilsons,’ and many of our ‘Gillots,’ a further remembrance
is likely to remain for all time.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c009'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Such names
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>as these, however, offer no kind of comparison with
that of ‘Margaret.’ This is the only rival that
‘Gillian’ had to fear, and had the misfortunes of
Margaret of Anjou occurred two, or even one century
earlier, it would easily have taken precedence, so far
as our surnames are concerned. Apart from its being
found in several royal lines, it had the advantage of
undoubted prettiness both in sound and sense. Every
one, too, knew its meaning, for ‘margarite’ and
‘pearl’ then, and until the seventeenth century even,
were interchangeable terms. Every early writer so
uses it. ‘Casting pearls before swine’ is with Wickliffe
‘margaritis.’<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c009'><sup>[63]</sup></a> The pet names too were pretty,
important in a day when the full name was rarely if
ever used.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c009'><sup>[64]</sup></a> The Norman-French ‘Margot’ seems to
have been quite as familiar as ‘Marjorie.’ Thus the
homely ‘magpie’ was at first styled the ‘maggoty’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>or ‘magot-pie.’ Many will remember that Macbeth
so uses it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>Blood will have blood:</div>
      <div class='line'>Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak,</div>
      <div class='line'>Augurs and understood relations have</div>
      <div class='line'>By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth</div>
      <div class='line'>The secretest man of blood.—ii. 7.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Madge-owlet,’ too, from its occasional use by writers
of this later period, seems to prove that the still more
homely owl of the barn owed an appellation to Dame
Marjorie. Her issue, as we should expect, is large.
We have ‘Maggs,’ ‘Maggots,’ and ‘Magotson;’ ‘Margots,’
‘Margetts,’ and ‘Margetson;’ ‘Margison,’ ‘Margerison,’
‘Meggs,’ and ‘Megson.’<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c009'><sup>[65]</sup></a> It will be surprising
to many that we cannot place ‘Mary’ in the first place
among female names, as it is now among those of
either sex, but such was far from the case. Edward I.’s
daughter ‘Marie’ seems to have been the first instance
we possess of its use among the higher families of the
realm; and doubtless its presence at this time must be
referred, as in so many other cases we have mentioned,
to the Crusades. Mariolatry, we must remember, was
not yet an article of Romish belief. Indeed, the name
is still of the rarest for generations after this. Maid
Marion, the mistress of Robin Hood, seems to have
made that diminutive popular, and either from the acted
plays in which she frequently afterwards figured, or
the little ornamental image of the Virgin worn by
women, is come our <i>marionette</i>. The one only form
in which it can be said to occur in our English records
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>is that of ‘Mariot,’ such names as ‘Mariot Goscelyn,’
or ‘Mariota Giffard,’ or ‘Mariota Gosebeck,’ being
found as a very occasional registry. Thus our ‘Mariotts’
and ‘Maryatts’ are explained. With regard to
another batch of names said to have sprung from this,
I find a difficulty sets in. We have the clear statement
of the author of the ‘Promptorium Parvulorum’
that ‘Malkyne’ in his day was the sobriquet of Matilda,
that is, ‘Mawdkin.’ On the other hand, I find Halliwell
has a single quotation from a manuscript in which
Maid Marion is styled Malkyn also.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c009'><sup>[66]</sup></a> All modern
writers, saving Mr. Lower, who has come to no decision
at all, have comfortably put it down to this latter.
I have no hesitation whatever myself in deciding differently,
or at least in qualifying their conclusion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>There can be scarcely any doubt, I think, that Malkin
was originally the pet name of Matilda; then, as that
favourite name gradually sunk in estimation, and Mary
proportionately advanced, but this much later on, it was
transferred. Thus, if I am correct, our ‘Makinsons’
and ‘Makins,’<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c009'><sup>[67]</sup></a> our ‘Meakins’ and ‘Meekins,’ and our
‘Mawsons’<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c009'><sup>[68]</sup></a> will be sprung from Maud, rather than
Mary. In confirmation of this, I may quote ‘Malkin,’
the early cant term for a ‘slut,’ a word as old as
Chaucer himself, and one that Mary could not have
possibly acquired in his day, as barely familiar.
‘Mawdkin’ or ‘Malkin,’ on the other hand, would be
the ordinary term for every household drudge. It is
only those who have carefully studied early registers
who can realize the difference of position ‘Matilda’
and ‘Mary’ relatively occupy at such a period as this.
There were six ‘Matildas’ of royal lineage between
William I. and Henry II. alone. It greets one at every
turn; the present popularity of the latter is entirely the
growth of a later and more superstitious age.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c009'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking of Mary, we must not forget Elizabeth,
known, generations ere Queen Bess made it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>so popular, as Isabella. It was in this form it came
into England with that princess of Angoulême who
married John Lackland. But it was not a favourite;
pretty as it was, its connexion with our most
despicable monarch spoiled all chance of popularity,
and while on the Continent it gained friends on every
hand, it was only with the higher nobility of our own
land it got any place worth speaking of. Still it has
left its mark. As Elizabeth<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c009'><sup>[70]</sup></a> at a later stage became
‘Lib’ and ‘Libby,’ so Isabel was fondled into ‘Ib’ and
‘Ibby.’ Thus we come across such entries as ‘Henry
Ebison,’ ‘Thomas Ibson,’ or ‘John Ibson.’ But a
foreign name without the foreign desinence would be
impossible. With the introduction of Isabel came in
the diminutive ‘Ibbot’ or ‘Ibbet.’ Registrations like
‘Ibbota fil. Adam,’ ‘Ibote Babyngton,’ or ‘Ebote Gylle,’
and as surnames ‘Walter Ibbot,’ ‘Robert fil. Ibote,’
‘Francis Ibbitson,’ or ‘Alice Ebotson’ are of common
occurrence.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c009'><sup>[71]</sup></a> Another form of the same diminutive was
‘Isot,’ hence ‘Isotte Symes,’ ‘Izott Barn,’ or ‘Ezota
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Hall.’<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c009'><sup>[72]</sup></a> But even with this we have not completed our
list. One more pet form, and one still common
amongst us, that of ‘Bell,’ left its mark in ‘Bellot,’
‘Bellet,’ and ‘Bellson,’ all of which are still to be
found in our directories.</p>

<p class='c007'>The preceding pages will be sufficient proof that our
metronymics are a considerable class. Many have not
hesitated to affirm them to be wholly of illegitimate
descent. We cannot doubt that in some instances this
is the case. Nevertheless, we must not be led astray.
‘Polson’ is Paul’s son, ‘Nelson’ is Neil’s son, Neil
or Nigel being at one time a familiar name with us.
And even when the name is unquestionably feminine,
as in Mollison, Margerison, Marriot, Emmett, or
Annotson, illegitimacy is anything but established as
a matter of fact. Adoption of children by women,
posthumous birth, and other peculiar circumstances
would often cause a boy or girl to be known in the
community by a metronymic. Especially, too, would
a child be thus styled in a family where the mother
was notoriously, and in an emphatic sense, the better
half, in a family where the husband was content to sit in
the chimney nook, and let the bustling Margery, or
Siss, or Emmot take, whether in or out of doors, the
lead in all that concerned the domestic relationship.
Thus, I doubt not, a large mass of them have arisen.</p>
<h3 class='c020'>VII.—<i>Names Derived from Holy Scripture.</i></h3>

<p class='c018'>We have incidentally referred to several Bible
names, such as John, Mary, or Elizabeth. We shall
find a certain characteristic appertaining to these. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>is only those personages who prominently figured
in the Scripture narrative who made any mark upon
our nomenclature. The others, I doubt not, were
unknown. It is even uncertain whether the clergy
themselves had any but the faintest knowledge of the
Bible. Indeed, such names even as were in use bear
no testimony to the fact that they were given as the
direct result of familiarity with the sacred pages. If
from the New Testament, they were names that figured
in the calendar as saints and martyrs, names to whom
shrines and chapels had been dedicated. If from the
Old, they were just those like ‘Adam,’ or ‘Isaac,’ or
‘Joseph,’ or ‘Samson,’ or ‘Daniel,’ or ‘Absolom,’
whose stories, told in the monkish performances or
miracle-plays, were thus forced into the acquaintance
of the popular mind. In a word, there is not a trace
of anything beyond a mere superficial knowledge of
the very outlines of the sacred narrative. Thus was it
with ‘Adam,’ already mentioned. That he and Eve
should be remembered at the font was inevitable.
The Hundred Rolls give us an ‘Adam fil. Eve.’
Mr. Lower has been tempted to refer our ‘Atkins’ and
‘Atkinsons’ to Arthur, but there can be little doubt,
I imagine, that these are but sharper forms of ‘Adkins’
and ‘Adkinson.’ The record alluded to above registers
the same person twice as ‘Adam le Fullere’ and
‘Adekin le Fuller.’ With them therefore we must ally
our ‘Addisons,’ ‘Adcocks,’<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c009'><sup>[73]</sup></a> and ‘Adamsons.’ Eve left
us ‘Eveson’ as a metronymic, and ‘Evetts’ and ‘Evitts,’
as the diminutives, are firmly set amongst us.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c009'><sup>[74]</sup></a> ‘Abel’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>was equally popular. The Norman desinence is found
in such entries as ‘Abalotta de la Forde,’ or Richard
Abelot, whose descendants now figure as ‘Ablett’ and
‘Ablott.’ As will be seen, these may be feminine
in origin. The reverence of the despised Jew for
Abraham prevented this from becoming acceptable to
Christians, but Isaac’s sacrifice was too popular a story
not to leave an impression. It would be frequently
represented by the monks. I have already quoted
Langland where he speaks of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hikke the hackney-man</div>
      <div class='line'>And Hugh the nedlere—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>an abbreviation now more generally known and spelt
as ‘Ike.’ Gower also has it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Watte</i> vocat, cui <i>Thoma</i> venit, neque <i>Symme</i> retardat,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Bat</i>-que <i>Gibbe</i> simul, <i>Hykke</i> venire jubent.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>From him then have arisen our ‘Isaacs’ and ‘Isaacsons,’
our ‘Hicks’ and ‘Hicksons,’ our ‘Higgs’ and
‘Higsons,’ and with the Norman-French diminutives
appended, our ‘Higgins,’ ‘Higginsons,’ ‘Higgotts,’<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c009'><sup>[75]</sup></a> and
‘Higgetts.’ ‘Sarah,’ in the dress of ‘Sarra,’ had a fair
number of admirers. ‘Sarra le Commongere,’ ‘William
fil. Sarra,’ ‘Nicholas fil. Sarre,’ is the usual entry. The
origin of our ‘Sarsons’ would thus be certain, were it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>not that this name, as will be shown elsewhere, has got
confused with ‘Saracen.’ Moses also failed to be accepted
among Christians, nor was Aaron much more
fortunate, such registration as ‘Aaron le Blund’ or
‘Aron Judde’ being rare. ‘Samson’ or ‘Sampson,’
as it is more generally recorded, was of course popular
enough, and many of our ‘Sampsons’ are rather the
simple ‘Samson’ than the patronymic of ‘Samuel.’
‘Samms,’ ‘Samuels’ and ‘Samuelson’ are generally of
Jewish descent. ‘David,’ with its ‘Davies,’ its ‘Davidsons,’
its ‘Dawes’ and ‘Dawsons,’ its ‘Dawkes’ and
‘Dawkins,’ or ‘Dawkinsons,’ its ‘Dayes,’ ‘Daysons,’
and ‘Dakins’ (when not ‘Deakin’), would be equally
sure of remembrance; though doubtless, as the patron
saint of the Principality, and as a favourite among
Scottish kings, it owes much to these outer chances.
Here, too, we are reminded of Piers Plowman, with
his—</p>

<p class='c017'>This nickname seems to have had a long reign in the
popular mouth, for we find, towards the close of the
sixteenth century, Haywood writing the following

<p class='c017'>Passing by ‘Absolom,’ ‘Solomon,’ or ‘Salamon,’ ‘Job’
and ‘Jobson,’ the story of Daniel would of course be
common. This has bequeathed us itself in <i>propria persona</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and ‘Dancock,’ ‘Dankin,’ ‘Danett,’ and ‘Dannett.’
With regard to ‘Dans,’ ‘Dance,’ ‘Danse,’ and ‘Danson,’
there is a little difficulty. We have to remember that
‘Dan,’ like ‘Dame,’<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c009'><sup>[77]</sup></a> figured prominently in early days
as a simple title of respect. They were but the ‘Don’
and ‘Donna’ which, in one form or another, still exist
in Italy, France, and Spain. ‘Dame,’ from domina,
meant ‘mistress.’ ‘Don,’ from dominus, meant ‘master.’
To rank and age the two terms were equally
applied. A ‘dame’s school’ still preserves this connexion
of ideas. ‘As with the mistress so with the
maid,’ is in early Bibles ‘As with the dame so with the
maid.’ Thus there seems to be little doubt that our
‘Dames’ and ‘Damsons’ are so sprung. Why then
should not ‘Dans’ and ‘Danse’ and ‘Danson’ be the
masculine form? Chaucer, in his Canterbury Tales,
represents the host as asking the Monk—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But, by my trothe, I cannot tell your name:</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether shall I call you my lord Dan John,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or Dan Thomas, or elles Dan Albon?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus he speaks also of ‘Dan Constantine,’ and jestingly
of the ass as ‘Dan Burnell.’ Thus, Lord Surrey
in one of his poems speaks of ‘Dan Homer;’
Spenser of ‘Dan Geoffrey;’ Thomson of ‘Dan Abraham.’
The best way will be, as in many another case,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>to divide the honours between the two; and leaving it
thus undecided, I pass on.</p>
<p class='c007'>Nor is the New Testament without its instances.
Let us look at the Apostles first. We have already
spoken at some length about ‘John,’ but we purposely
kept for the present opportunity the explanation of
its popularity in England. There can be little doubt
that it owes much to its religious aspect. It was the
name not merely of the beloved disciple, but of the
Baptist. New and close associations with the latter
were just coming into being. We must remember
this was the time of the Crusades. It was the custom
of all pilgrims who visited the Holy Land to bring
back a bottle of water from the Jordan for baptismal
purposes. A leathern bottle was an inseparable
adjunct to the palmer’s dress. We all remember
Walter Scott’s description—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His sandals were with travel tore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Staff, budget, <i>bottle</i>, scrip he wore:</div>
      <div class='line'>The faded palm-branch in his hand</div>
      <div class='line'>Showed pilgrim from the Holy Land.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Early scenes with regard to the river in which the
Baptist specially figured would thus be vividly brought
to their notice, and in the ceremony of baptism at
home nothing could be more natural than to give to
the infant the name of the baptizer of the Holy Child
Jesus. This is strongly confirmed by the fact of the
name taking precedence at this very period. It was
thus ‘Jordan’ itself as a surname has arisen. I need
not remind students of early records how common is
‘Jordan’ as a Christian name, such cognomens as
‘Jordan de Abingdon’ or ‘Jordan le Clerc’ being of the
most familiar occurrence. The baptismal soon became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>surnominal, and now ‘Jordan,’<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c009'><sup>[78]</sup></a> ‘Jordanson,’ ‘Jordson,’
‘Jurdan,’ ‘Judd,’ and ‘Judson’<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c009'><sup>[79]</sup></a> are with us to remind
us of this peculiar and interesting epoch.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c009'><sup>[80]</sup></a> We have a
remarkable confirmation of what I am asserting in the
fact of the Baptist’s other name of ‘Elias’ springing
into a sudden notoriety at this time. If ‘John’
became thus so popular, it was inevitable ‘Elias’
should be the same; and so it was. Indeed, there
was a time when it bid fair to be one of the most
familiar sobriquets in England. For it was not merely
the second Elias and the Jordan that had this effect.
As the armies lay before Acre, remembrance of Elijah
and the prophet of Carmel must have oft recurred to
their minds. Out of many forms to be found in every
early roll, those of ‘Ellis,’ ‘Elys,’ ‘Elice,’ ‘Ellice,’
‘Elyas,’ ‘Helyas,’ and the diminutive ‘Eliot’ or
‘Elliot,’ seem to have been the most familiar. Numberless
are the surnames sprung from it. It is thus
we get our ‘Ellises’ and ‘Ellices,’ our ‘Ellsons’
and ‘Ellisons,’ our ‘Elkins’ and ‘Elkinsons,’ our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>‘Elcocks’ and ‘Ellcocks,’ and our ‘Ellicots,’<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c009'><sup>[81]</sup></a>
‘Elliots,’ and ‘Elliotsons.’ In the north ‘Alis’
seems to have gained the supremacy. Thus it is we
have our many ‘Allisons’ or ‘Alisons,’<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c009'><sup>[82]</sup></a> ‘Allkins’ or
‘Alkins,’ ‘Allcocks’ or ‘Alcocks,’ and ‘Allots.’
‘Alecot,’ as a synonym with ‘Elicot,’ I do not find to
be at present existing, but as a Christian name it
occurs at the same period with the above.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c009'><sup>[83]</sup></a> ‘Fitzellis,’
as the more aristocratic Norman form, is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>yet, I believe, extinct. Thus the prophet at Carmel
and the forerunner at the Jordan have made their
mark upon our English nomenclature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Peter claims our attention next. When we consider
how important has been the position claimed for
him it is remarkable that in an age when, so far as
England was concerned, this respect was more fully
exacted than any other, his name should be so rarely
found, rarely when we reflect what an influence the
ecclesiastics of the day themselves must have had in
the choice of the baptismal name, and what an interest
they had in making it popular. It is to them,
doubtless, we must refer the fact of its having made
any mark at all, for ‘Peter’ was odious to English
ears. It reminded them of a tax which was the one
of all least liked, as they saw none of its fruits. It is
to country records we must look for the ‘Peters’ of
the time. The freer towns would none of it. Among
the rude peasantry ecclesiastic control was well-nigh
absolute; in the boroughs it was proportionately less.
I have already quoted an instance of 133 London
names where Peter is discovered but once to 35 Johns.
In the Norwich Guild already mentioned, the proportion,
or rather disproportion, is the same. To 128
Johns, 47 Williams, 41 Thomases, 33 Roberts, and 21
Richards, there are but 4 Peters. On the other hand,
in Wiltshire, out of 588 names, we find 16 Peters to
92 Johns. This wide difference of ratio I find to be
fully borne out in all other groups of early names.
Thanks then to the ecclesiastics it did exist, and its
relics at any rate are numerous enough. It is hence
we get the shorter ‘Parr,’ ‘Piers,’ ‘Pierce,’ ‘Pears,’
‘Pearse,’ and ‘Peers.’ It is hence with the patronymic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>added we get our ‘Parsons,’ ‘Pearsons,’ ‘Piersons,’
and the fuller ‘Peterson.’ It is hence once more with
the pet desinences attached we get our ‘Perrins’ and
‘Perrens,’ our ‘Perrets,’ ‘Perretts,’ ‘Parrots,’ and
‘Parrets,’<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c009'><sup>[84]</sup></a> our ‘Peterkins,’ ‘Perkins,’ ‘Parkins,’ and
‘Parkinsons,’ besides our ‘Perks’ and ‘Perkes’ innumerable.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Simon,’ or ‘Simeon,’ is represented by at least
sixteen different personages in the Scriptures, so we
may well expect to find that it has also impressed
itself upon our own registers. The usual forms of
the name in mediæval rolls is ‘Sim,’ ‘Simkin,’ and
‘Simonet.’ Thus we find such entries as ‘Simon fil.
Sim,’ ‘Simkin Cock,’ ‘Symkyn Edward,’ ‘Simonettus
Mercator,’ or ‘Symonet Vaillain.’ The French
diminutive does not seem to have been so popular
as that which the Flemings made so common, for I
find no ‘Simnets’ in our directories, while a whole
column has to be set aside for our ‘Simpkins’ and
‘Simpkinsons.’ ‘Simcock’ must have existed also, as
our ‘Simcocks’ and ‘Simcoxes’ can testify. Other
forms are found in ‘Sims,’ ‘Simms,’ ‘Simpson,’
‘Simmons,’ ‘Simonds,’ ‘Symonds,’ ‘Simmonds,’ and
‘Symondsons.’ This latter is met with in the Rolls
of Parliament in the guise of ‘Symondesson.’ ‘Philip,’
as another of the Apostles of Jesus, was also popular.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>As with ‘Simon,’ most of the nursery forms are still
found as the chief components of its surnames.
Skelton, the poet-laureate—in lieu of a better—of
Henry VIII., reminds us of its chief contraction,
‘Philp,’ or ‘Phip,’ in his lines on a dead sparrow,
named Philip:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Many times and oft,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon my finger aloft,</div>
      <div class='line'>I played with him, tittle-tattle,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fed him with my spattle,</div>
      <div class='line'>With his bill between my lips.</div>
      <div class='line'>It was my pretty Phips.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus we derive our ‘Phelps,’ ‘Philps,’ ‘Phipps,’ and
‘Phipson.’ Adding to these our ‘Philips,’ ‘Philipsons,’
‘Philcoxes,’ ‘Philpotts,’ and ‘Phillots,’ we see that we
are not likely soon to be quit of Philip. He is now,
however, out of fashion as a Christian name. ‘Philpot,’<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c009'><sup>[85]</sup></a>
I need scarcely say, was very popular as the representative
of the Norman-French ‘Philipot,’ found in such
entries as ‘Thomas Phylypotte,’ or ‘John Philipot;’
but endeavours to deduce his origin as well in spelling
as in sound from the characteristics displayed by the
renowned Toby Phillpot are not wanting, for I see
him figuring in the ‘London Directory’ as ‘Fillpot.’
Archbishop Trench quotes from one of Careless’s
letters to Philpot the following passage, which serves
to show that three hundred years ago at least the
name had been played upon in similar fashion: ‘Oh,
good Master Philpot (he says), which art a principal
<i>pot</i> indeed, <i>filled</i> with much precious liquor—oh, pot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>most happy! of the High Potter ordained to honour.’
Some years ago, when a Philpott was appointed to the
episcopal chair of Worcester, Dr. Philpotts being yet
at Exeter, the following lines got abroad:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A good appointment?’ ‘No, it’s not,’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Said old beer-drinking Peter Watts;</div>
      <div class='line'>‘At Worcester one but hears “Phil-pott;”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At generous Exeter, “Phil-potts.”’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Fillpot’ as well as ‘Fillip’ are both found in
mediæval registers in the cases of ‘Roger Fylpot’ and
‘Walter Felip.’ An old song, quoted in ‘Political
Poems’ (i. 60), says of the defeated soldiers at Halidon
Hill:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>On Filip Valas fast cri they,</div>
      <div class='line'>There for to dwell, and him avaunce.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The ‘Fillpots’ of our present directories may therefore
have thus spelt their names for four or five hundred
years. Anyhow they have precedent for the
form.</p>
<p class='c007'>‘Matthew the Publican’ seems to have been a
favourite alike in England and France. ‘Matt’ was
the homely appellative, and thus besides ‘Mathews’
and ‘Mathewson,’ we meet with ‘Matts,’ ‘Matson,’
‘Mattison,’ and ‘Mattinson.’ Our ‘Mayhews’ represent
the foreign dress, and can refer their origin to
such personages as ‘Adam fil. Maheu,’ or ‘Mayeu
de Basingbourne.’ ‘Bartholomew,’ for what reason I
can scarcely say, was a prime favourite with our
forefathers, and has left innumerable proofs of the
same. ‘Batt’ or ‘Bett’ seems to have been the
favourite curtailment. The author of ‘Piers Plowman’
speaks of ‘Bette the Bocher’ (Butcher), ‘Bette
the Bedel,’ and makes Reason bid</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Bette kutte</div>
      <div class='line'>A bough outher tweye,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bete Beton therewith.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Batty,’ ‘Bates,’ ‘Batson,’ ‘Batcock,’ ‘Badcock,’
‘Batkins,’ ‘Badkins,’ ‘Betson,’ ‘Bedson,’ and ‘Betty’
are relics of this. ‘Bartle,’ and the Norman-French
‘Bartelot,’ found in such entries as ‘Bartel Frobisher,’
‘John fil. Bertol,’ ‘Bartelot Govi,’ or ‘Edward Barttlette,’
at once bespeak the origin of our ‘Bartles’ and
‘Bartletts.’<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c009'><sup>[86]</sup></a> Nor was this all. Another favourite
sobriquet for this same name was ‘Toly’ or ‘Tholy,’
hence such registrations as ‘Tholy Oldcorn,’ or
‘Robert Toly,’ or ‘William fil. Tholy.’ Our ‘Tolleys,’
‘Tollys’ and ‘Tolsons’<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c009'><sup>[87]</sup></a> are thus explained. None of
these could have been the offspring of any old ‘Ladye
Betty,’ as Mr. Lower seems to imagine, since that
name, as I have shown, did not exist in England at
this time, nor in fact can it be said to have been known
till rendered fashionable by Elizabeth Woodville, the
bride of Edward IV. What an influence a single individual
may wield over our personal nomenclature
may be thus seen, when we remember the enormous
preponderance of this latter name during the two
centuries that followed the reign of the imperious but
‘good Queen Bess,’ and the glorious scattering of
the Spanish Armada. This, too, escaping the withering
influences of the Puritan era, continued through
all, and now holds the fourth place in English esteem.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>In the poem I have just quoted, Reason</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Called Caton his knave</div>
      <div class='line'>Curteis of speche,</div>
      <div class='line'>And also Tomme Trewe-tonge.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus we see that ‘Tom,’ as the popular form of
‘Thomas,’ has been in vogue for many centuries.
‘Thomas,’ like some of the above names, received an
increased impulse from the Crusades. But another
circumstance also befriended it. In its numerous progeny
may be read again the story of the feud that
arose between the haughty Archbishop and Henry II.,
a feud that terminated so fatally for the former, and
made the spot where he fell hallowed for centuries
by the pilgrimages of shrine-worshippers. Piers, in
Langland’s poem, says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I nolde fange a ferthyng</div>
      <div class='line'>For seint Thomas shryne.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The surnames whose origin we must undoubtedly
attribute, in the majority of cases, to the notoriety
given to the sobriquet possessed by this murdered
prelate are many. The patronymic is clearly marked
in our ‘Thomasons,’ ‘Thomsons,’ and ‘Thompsons.’
The favoured Norman diminutive is equally assured
of perpetuation in our ‘Thomasetts,’ ‘Thomsetts,’ and
‘Thompsetts;’ the Saxon being as fully popularised
in our ‘Thompkins,’ ‘Tompkins,’ ‘Tomkins,’ and
‘Tomkinsons.’ The softer termination is also firmly
settled in our ‘Thomlins,’ ‘Tomlins,’ and ‘Tomlinsons.’<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c009'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
More abbreviated patronymics are to be met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>with also in our ‘Thomms,’ ‘Thoms,’ and ‘Toms.’ With
so many representatives in the list of rational beings,
we need not be surprised to find the lower order of
creation under obligations to this title. It was with
the death of St. Thomas of Canterbury, and the consequent
popularity of his name, arose so many sobriquets
of which the same name became a component
part. The cat became a ‘tom-cat,’ a simple-natured
man a ‘tom-coney,’ a silly fellow a ‘tom-noddy’ or
‘tom-fool,’ a romping girl a ‘tom-boy,’ and a wren a
‘tom-tit.’ Andrew has made little impression on
English nomenclature, but in Scotland he is universal,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c009'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
for not only is St. Andrew the patron saint, but
some of his relics are said to have been brought thither
in the 4th century. ‘Andrew,’ ‘Andrews,’ and ‘Anderson’
are its surnames, but nearly all belong to the
north side of the Tweed. ‘James,’ too, has failed to
be popular in England, but ‘John’ in the shape of
‘Jack’ has robbed him, as we have seen, of nearly all
his property. Such entries as ‘James le Queynt,’ or
‘Ralph Jamson,’ or ‘William Gimmison,’ were occasionally
registered, and in the form of ‘James’
‘Jameson,’ ‘Jimson’ and ‘Jimpson’ they still exist.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c009'><sup>[90]</sup></a>
‘Jamieson’ is Scotch. Of the Gospel writers we have
already noticed ‘Matthew’ and ‘John.’ In ‘Mark’
we see the progenitor not merely of our ‘Marks’ and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the Latinized ‘Marcus,’ but of ‘Marcock,’ ‘Markin,’
and ‘Marson’ also. The mention of ‘Luke’ recalls
such names as ‘Luckins,’ ‘Luckock,’ ‘Lucock,’ or
‘Locock,’ ‘Luckett,’ and perchance ‘Lockett.’ It is
in the form of ‘Lucus,’ however, that he is generally
known. The author of ‘Piers Plowman’ speaks of
‘Marc,’ ‘Mathew,’ ‘Johan,’ and ‘Lucas.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the later period of New Testament history, few
names were better represented than ‘Nicholas,’ but it
was ‘St. Nicholas’ of the fourth century who chiefly
gave it its position. Owing to several well-known legends
that connected themselves with this famous
Archbishop of Myra, he became the patron saint of
boys, sailors, parish clerks, and even thieves. Two
of the most favoured curtailments of this name were
‘Nicol’ and ‘Nick.’ From the one we have derived our
‘Nicholls’ and ‘Nicholsons;’ from the other our
‘Nixs,’ ‘Nicks,’ ‘Nixons,’ ‘Nicksons,’ and ‘Nickersons.’
Judging from our surnames, ‘Nick’ was the more
favoured term. In the old song ‘Joan to the Maypole,’
it is said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>Nan, Noll, Kate, Moll,</div>
      <div class='line'>Brave lasses have lads to attend ’em;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Hodge, Nick, Tom, Dick,</div>
      <div class='line'>Brave country dancers, who can amend ’em?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>But the most popular form of all was that of
‘Cole’<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c009'><sup>[91]</sup></a> or ‘Colin,’ which came to us through the Normans.
‘Colin’ is one more instance of the diminutive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>‘on’ or ‘in.’ Thus we derive our ‘Collins,’ ‘Collinsons,’
and ‘Colsons.’ The more usual desinence still
lives in our ‘Colletts’ and ‘Colets.’ This is the form
found in one of the ‘Coventry Mysteries,’ where allusion
is made to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Kytt Cakeler, and Colett Crane,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gylle Fetyse, and Fayr Jane.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Miss Yonge mentions a ‘Collette Boilet’ who, in the
fifteenth century, caused a reformation of the nuns
of St. Clara, and Mr. Lower has a ‘St. Colette,’
whose parents had given him the name out of respect
to ‘St. Nicholas.’ ‘Coletta Clarke’ is found in Clutterbuck’s
‘Hertford’ (Index). St. Nicholas, it is
clear, was not neglected.</p>
<p class='c007'>The proto-martyr Stephen has left many memorials
in our nomenclature of the popularity which his story
obtained among the English peasantry. The name
proper is found in such entries as ‘Esteven Walays,’
or ‘Jordan fil. Stephen,’ and their descendants now
figure amongst us as ‘Stephens,’ ‘Stevens,’ ‘Stephenson,’
and ‘Stevenson.’ More curtailed forms are met
with in ‘Steenson’ and ‘Stinson,’ and the more corrupted
‘Stimson’ and ‘Stimpson.’ The Norman
diminutive was of course ‘Stevenet’ or ‘Stevenot,’
and this still remains with us in our ‘Stennets’ and
‘Stennetts.’ Nor do Paul and Barnabas lack memorials.
Traces of the former are found in our ‘Polsons,’<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c009'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
‘Pawsons,’ ‘Powlsons,’ and more correct ‘Paulsons.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>In one of these, at least, we are reminded of
the old pronunciation of this name. Piers Plowman
styles it ‘Powel,’ and even so late as 1562 we find
Heywood writing the following epigram:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Rob Peter and pay Poule, thou sayst I do;</div>
      <div class='line'>But thou robst and poulst Peter and Poule, too.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This at once explains the origin of our more diminutive
‘Pauletts,’ ‘Pouletts,’ ‘Powletts,’ and ‘Pollitts.’<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c009'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
‘Barnabas’ has left his impress upon our ‘Barnabys,’
and when not local, ‘Barnbys.’ Miss Yonge mentions
an epitaph in Durham, dated 1633, commemorative of
one of the proctors of the chapter—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Under this thorne tree</div>
      <div class='line'>Lies honest Barnabee.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>A century later we find it in one of D’Orsey’s ballads—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Davy the drowsy, and Barnaby bowzy,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This name is now entirely out of fashion.</p>
<p class='c007'>With five Alexanders in the New Testament it
did not need the celebrity of the great commander
nor that of more fabulous heroes to make his name
common. In Scotland it obtained great favour, both
in palace and cottage. The softer form was always
used. Chaucer says—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>This was no doubt the popular pronunciation of the
time, except that it was usually abbreviated into
‘Sander,’ or ‘Saunder.’ Thus, in ‘Cocke Lorells Bote,’
it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here is Saunder Sadeler, of Frog-street Corner,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Hence it is we find such entries as ‘Thomas fil.
Saundre,’ ‘John Alisaundre,’ ‘Edward Saundercock,’
or ‘Sandres Ewart,’ and hence again such surnames
as ‘Sandercock,’ ‘Sanderson,’ ‘Saunderson,’ ‘Sanders,’
and ‘Saunders.’ ‘Timothy,’ saving in ‘Timms,’ ‘Timbs,’
‘Timson,’ and ‘Timcock,’ seems to have been overlooked,
and yet Glutton in ‘Piers Plowman’ is followed

<p class='c017'>But, however unfortunate Paul’s spiritual son may
have been, the same cannot be said of Clement, his
fellow-labourer. Raised to high distinction as the
title of one of the greatest of the early fathers, a
popular name among the Popes (for no less than
fourteen were found to bear the sobriquet), Clement
could not fail to meet with honour. Its usual forms
were ‘Clement,’ ‘Clemence,’ and ‘Clemency.’ Diminutives
were found also in ‘Clem’ and ‘Clim.’ Of
the noted North English archer it is said, in one of
the Robin Hood ballads—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And Clim of the Clough hath plenty enough,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>If he but a penny can spare;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and in the old song of the ‘Green-gown’ a rhyme is
easily secured by the conjunction of such names as—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Clem, Joan, and Isabel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sue, Alice, and bonny Nell.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The chief surnames whose paternity is traceable to
‘Clement’ are ‘Clements,’ ‘Clementson,’ ‘Clemms,’
‘Clemson,’ and ‘Clempson.’ Archangelic names are
found in our ‘Gabbs,’ ‘Gabbots,’ and ‘Gabcocks,’
from ‘Gabriel;’ and in our ‘Michaelson,’ ‘Mitchels,’
and ‘Mitchelsons,’ from ‘Michael.’</p>
<p class='c007'>But let us somewhat more closely analyse these
names. As I have said before, from the most casual
survey one thing is evident, they represent the
Church’s Calendar rather than the Church’s Bible.
They are the extract of sacred legends rather than of
Holy Writ. There is not a single name to betray any
internal acquaintance with the Scriptures. Nor could
there well be. An English Bible was unknown, and
had there been one to consult, the reading powers of
the nation were too limited for it to have been much
used. Many of the clergy themselves could not read.
Thus the Bible, so far as extends beyond the leading
incidents it contains, was a sealed book. This had
its effect upon our nomenclature. We cannot find a
single trace of acquaintance with its rarer histories.
What a wide change in this respect did Wicklyffe
and the Reformation effect! With an English Bible
in their hand, with the clearing away of the mists of
ignorance and superstition, with the destruction of all
forces that could obstruct the spread of knowledge,
all was altered. The Bible, posted up in every church,
might be read of all—and all who could probably did
read it. This at once had its effect upon our nomenclature.
Names familiar enough in our own day to
those ordinarily conversant with the Scriptures, but
till then absolutely unknown, were brought forth from
their hiding-places and made subservient to the new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>impulse of the nation. Names associated with the
more obscure books, and with personages less directly
confronting us in our study of the Word, begin now
to be inscribed upon our registers. The ‘Proceedings
in Chancery’ is the best evidence how far this had
affected our nomenclature towards the close of the
reign of Elizabeth. We come across such names, for
example, as ‘Ezechie Newbold,’ ‘Dyna Bocher,’
‘Phenenna Salmon,’ ‘Ezekiel Guppye,’ ‘Dedimus
Buckland,’ ‘Esdras Botright,’ ‘Sydrach Sympson,’
‘Judith Botswain,’ ‘Isachar Brookes,’ ‘Gamaliel
Capell,’ ‘Emanuel Cole,’ ‘Abigaill Cordell,’ ‘Reuben
Crane,’ ‘Amos Boteler,’ ‘Philologus Forth,’ ‘Zabulon
Clerke,’ ‘Archelaus Gifford,’ ‘Gideon Hancock,’ ‘Seth
Awcocke,’ ‘Abacucke Harman,’ or ‘Melchizedek
Payn.’ The ‘State Papers’ (domestic) of James I.’s
reign are still more largely imbued with the new
influence. We are now brought face to face with
entries such as ‘Uriah Babington,’ ‘Aquila Wykes,’
‘Hilkiah Crooke,’ ‘Caleb Morley,’ ‘Philemon Powell,’
‘Melchior Rainald,’ ‘Zachæus Ivitt,’ ‘Ananias Dyce,’
‘Agrippina Bingley,’ ‘Apollonia Cotton,’ or ‘Phineas
Pett.’ So far, however, the change was of a certain
kind. These new names did not clash with the
old nomenclature. There was a greater variety,
that was all. Both romance and sacred names went
together, and in the same family might be seen ‘John’
and ‘Ralph,’ ‘Isaac’ and ‘Robert,’ ‘Reuben’ and
‘Richard.’ But a new spirit was being infused into
the heart of the nation, that spirit which at length
brought about the Puritan Commonwealth. We all
know how this great change came. It is neither our
intention, nor need we enter into it here. Sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>for our purpose that it came. This revolution marvellously
affected our nomenclature. It was not
simply that the old and, so to speak, pagan names
‘William,’ ‘Roland,’ ‘Edward,’ ‘Ralph,’ ‘Aymon,’
and a hundred others, once household words, were
condemned to oblivion, but even the names of the
Christian saints were ignored. ‘Cromwell,’ says
Cleveland, ‘hath beat up his drums clean through the
Old Testament—you may know the genealogy of our
Saviour by the names of his regiment. The muster
master hath no other list than the first chapter of St.
Matthew.’ The Old Testament, indeed, seems to
have been alone in favour.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c009'><sup>[94]</sup></a> The practice of choosing
such designations borrowed therefrom as ‘Enoch,’
‘Hiram,’ ‘Seth,’ ‘Phineas,’ ‘Eli,’ ‘Obadiah,’ ‘Job,’
‘Joel,’ ‘Hezekiah,’ ‘Habbakuk,’ ‘Caleb,’ ‘Zeruiah,’
‘Joshua,’ ‘Hephzibah,’ or ‘Zerubbabel,’ has left its
mark to this very day, especially in our more retired
country districts. Self-abasement showed itself, at
least externally, in the choice of names of bad repute.
‘Cains,’ ‘Absoloms,’ ‘Abners,’ ‘Delilahs,’ ‘Dinahs,’
‘Tamars,’ ‘Korahs,’ ‘Abirams,’ and ‘Sapphiras,’<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c009'><sup>[95]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>abounded. Nor was this all. Of all excesses those
of a religious character are proverbially most intemperate
in their course. Abstract qualities, prominent
words of Scriptures, nay, even short and familiar
sentences culled from its pages, or parodied, were
tacked on to represent the Christian name. Camden
mentions, as existing in his own day, such appellations
as ‘Free-gift,’ ‘Reformation,’ ‘Earth,’ ‘Dust,’
‘Ashes,’ ‘Delivery,’ ‘Morefruit,’ ‘Tribulation,’ ‘The
Lord is near,’ ‘More trial,’ ‘Discipline,’ ‘Joy again,’
‘From above’—names which, he says, ‘have lately
been given by some to their children, with no evil
meaning, but upon some singular and precise conceit.’
‘Praise-God-Barebones’ is but another specimen of
this extraordinary spirit. The brother of this latter
could boast a still longer sobriquet. He had chosen
for himself, it is said, the title,
‘If-Christ-had-not-died-for-you-you-had-been-damned-Barebones,’
but his acquaintances becoming wearied of its length, retained only the
last word, and as ‘Damned-Barebones’ left him a sobriquet more curt than
pleasant. The following is a list of a jury said to have been enclosed
in the county of Sussex at this time, and selected of course from the
number of the Saints:—</p>

<p class='c017'>The above list may be thought by many a mere
burlesque, and so I doubt not it is, but a similar category
could be quickly put together from more reliable
sources, and some of the names therein set down did
certainly exist. The following entries are quoted by
Mr. Lower from the registers of Warbleton:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The ‘Proceedings in Chancery’ furnish us with
‘Virtue Hunt,’ ‘Temperance Dowlande,’ ‘Charitie
Bowes,’ and ‘Lamentation Chapman.’ The ‘Visitation
of Yorkshire’ gives us ‘Fayth Neville,’ ‘Grace Clayton,’
‘Troth Bellingham,’ and ‘Prudence Spenser;’
and amongst other more general instances may
be mentioned ‘Experience Mayhew,’<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c009'><sup>[97]</sup></a> ‘Abstinence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Pougher,’<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c009'><sup>[98]</sup></a> ‘Increase Mather,’<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c009'><sup>[99]</sup></a> ‘Thankfull Frewen,’

and rabid phases of this spirit have now passed
away, but the general effect remains. It is from this
date, I have said, must be noted the declension of such
a familiar name as ‘Humphrey,’ or ‘Ralph,’ or ‘Joscelyn,’
and of the romance names generally. From this
date we perceive the use of some of our present most familiar
and till then well-nigh unknown baptismal names.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the restoration of Charles II. much of the
more rhapsodic features of this curious spirit died out,
but it is more than probable it was fed elsewhere.
The rigorous persecution of the Nonconformists which
marked and blotted his reign, the persecuting spirit
which drove hundreds to seek beyond the seas that
asylum for religious liberty which was denied them at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>home, could have none other effect than to make
these settlers cling the more tenaciously to the new
scheme of doctrine and practice, for which they had
sacrificed so much. Thus the feeling which had led
them at home to allow the Written Word to be the
only source from which to select names for their
children, or to make substitutions for their own, was
not likely to be suppressed in the backwoods.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c009'><sup>[104]</sup></a> Their
very life and its surroundings there but harmonized
with the primitive histories of those whose names they
had chosen. A kind of affinity seemed to be established
between them. This spirit was fanned by the
very paucity of population, and the difficulty of keeping
up any connexion with the outer world. They
were shut up within themselves, and thus the Bible
became to them, not so much a record of the past as
that through which ran the chronicle of the present.
It was a living thread interwoven into their very lives.
Their history was inscribed in its pages, their piety
was fed by its doctrines. Its impress lay upon all, its
influence pervaded all. All this has left its mark
upon Anglo-American nomenclature—nay, to such a
degree do these influences still exist, that, though
derived from the same sources, the American system
and our own can scarce be viewed otherwise than as
separate and distinct. Rare, indeed, are the early
romance and the Teutonic names in those tracts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>where the descendants of the primitive settlers are
found. All are derived from the Scriptures, or are of
that fancy character, a love of which arose with their
Puritan forefathers. Appellations such as ‘Seth,’ or
‘Abel,’ or ‘Lot,’ or ‘Jonas,’ or ‘Asa,’ or ‘Jabez,’ or
‘Abijah,’ or ‘Phineas,’ or ‘Priscilla,’ or ‘Epaphroditus,’
abound on every hand. Sobriquets like
‘Faith,’ and ‘Hope,’ and ‘Charity,’ and ‘Patience,’
and ‘Prudence,’ and ‘Grace,’ and ‘Mercy,’ have become
literally as household words, and names yet
more uncouth and strange may be heard every day,
sounding oddly indeed to English ears. There would
seem to have been a revulsion of feeling, even from
such of the Biblical names as had lived in the earlier
centuries of our history, as if the connexion of ‘Peter,’
and ‘John,’ and ‘James,’ and ‘Thomas’ with others of
more pagan origin had made them unworthy of further
use; certain it is, that these are in no way so
familiar with them as with us. Such are the strange
humours that pass over the hearts of men and communities.
Such are the changes that the nomenclature
of peoples, as well as of places and things,
undergo through the more extraordinary convulsions
which sometimes seize the body corporate of society.
Truly it is a strange story this that our surnames tell
us. ‘What’s in a name?’ in the light of all this,
seems indeed but a pleasantry, meant to denote how
full, how teeming with the story of our lives is each—as
so they are.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>LOCAL SURNAMES.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In well-nigh every country where personal nomenclature
has assumed a sure and settled basis, that is,
where a second or surname has become an hereditary
possession in the family, we shall find that that portion
of it which is of local origin bears by far the
largest proportion to the whole. We could well proceed,
therefore, to this class apart from any other
motive, but when we further reflect that it is this local
class which in the first instance became hereditary, we
at once perceive an additional claim upon our attention.</p>
<p class='c007'>I need scarcely say at the outset that, as with all
countries so with England, prefixes of various kinds
were at first freely used to declare more particularly
whence the nominee was sprung. Thus, if he were
come from some town or city he would be ‘William
of York,’ or ‘John of Bolton,’ this enclitic being familiarly
pronounced ‘à,’ as ‘William a York,’ or ‘John a
Bolton.’ For instance, it is said in an old poem anent
Robin Hood—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It had been better of William a Trent</div>
      <div class='line'>To have been abed with sorrowe;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>where it simply means ‘William of Trent.’<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c009'><sup>[105]</sup></a> This, of
course, is met in France by ‘de,’ as it was also on
English soil during early Norman times. If, on the
other hand, the <i>situation</i> only of the abode gave the
personality of the nominee, the connecting link was
varied according to the humour or caprice of the
speaker, or the relative aspect of the site itself. Thus,
if we take up the old Hundred Rolls we shall find
such entries as ‘John Above-brook,’ or ‘Adelina
Above-town,’ or ‘Thomas Behind-water,’ or ‘John
Beneath-the-town.’ Or take a more extended instance,
such as ‘Lane.’ We find it attached to the
personal name in such fashions as the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Cecilia in the Lane.</div>
      <div class='line'>Emma a la Lane.</div>
      <div class='line'>John de la Lane.</div>
      <div class='line'>John de Lane.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mariota en le Lane.</div>
      <div class='line'>Philippa ate Lane.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thomas super Lane.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Brook,’ again, by the variety of the prefixes which I
find employed, may well be cited as a further example.
We have such entries as these:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Alice de la Broke.</div>
      <div class='line'>Andreas ate Broke.</div>
      <div class='line'>Peter ad le Broke.</div>
      <div class='line'>Matilda ad Broke.</div>
      <div class='line'>Reginald del Broke.</div>
      <div class='line'>Richard apud Broke.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sarra de Broke.</div>
      <div class='line'>Reginald bihunde Broke.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>These are extracts of more or less formal entries, but
they serve at least to show how it was at first a mere
matter of course to put in the enclitics that associated
the personal or Christian name with that which we
call the surname. Glancing over the instances just
quoted, we see that of these definitive terms some are
purely Norman, some equally purely Latin, a few are
an admixture of Norman and Latin, a common thing
in a day when the latter was the language of indenture,
and the rest are Saxon, ‘ate’ being the chief one.
This ‘atte’ was ‘at the,’ answering to the Norman
‘de la,’ ‘del,’ or ‘du,’ and was familiarly contracted
by our forefathers into the other forms of ‘ate’ and
‘att;’ or for the sake of euphony, when a vowel
preceded the name proper, extended to ‘atten.’ In
our larger and more formal Rolls these seldom occur,
owing to their being inscribed all but invariably in
the Norman-French or Latin style I have instanced
above, but in the smaller abbey records, and those of
a more private interest, these Saxon prefixes are
common. In the writers of the period they are familiarly
used. Thus, in the ‘Coventry Mysteries,’
mention is made of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thom Tynker, and Betrys Belle,</div>
      <div class='line'>Peyrs Potter, and Watt <i>at the</i> Well;<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c009'><sup>[106]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>while ‘Piers Plowman’ represents Covetousness as
saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For some tyme I served</div>
      <div class='line'>Symme <i>atte</i>-Style</div>
      <div class='line'>And was his prentice.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It may not be known to all my readers, probably not
even to all those most immediately concerned, that
this ‘atte’ or ‘att’ has fared with us in a manner
similar to that of the Norman ‘du’ and ‘de la.’ It
has occasionally been incorporated with the sobriquet
of locality, and thus become a recognised part of the
surname itself. Take the two names from the two
poems I have but just quoted, ‘Watt at the Well’
and ‘Symme atte Style.’ Now we have at this present
day but simple ‘Styles’ to represent this latter,
while in respect of the former we have not merely
‘Wells,’ but ‘Attwell,’ or ‘Atwell.’ These examples
are not solitary ones. Thus, such a name as ‘John
atte Wood,’ or ‘Gilbert atte Wode,’ has bequeathed
us not merely the familiar ‘Wood,’ but ‘Attwood’
and ‘Atwood’ also. ‘William atte Lea,’ that is, the
pasture, can boast a large posterity of ‘Leighs,’
‘Leghs,’ and ‘Lees;’ but he is well-nigh as commonly
represented by our ‘Atlays’ and ‘Attlees.’
And not to become tedious in illustrations, ‘atte-Borough’
is now ‘Attenborough’ or ‘Atterbury;’
‘atte-Ridge’ has become ‘Attridge,’ ‘atte-Field’
‘Atfield;’ while such other designations as ‘atte-Town,’
‘atte-Hill,’ ‘atte-Water,’ ‘atte-Worth,’ ‘atte-Tree,’
or ‘atte-Cliffe,’ are in this nineteenth century
of ours registered frequently as mere ‘Atton,’ ‘Athill,’
‘Atwater,’ ‘Atworth,’ ‘Attree,’ and ‘Atcliffe.’ Sometimes,
however, this prefix dropped down into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>simple ‘a.’ The notorious Pinder of Wakefield was
‘George a Green’ according to the ballads regarding
Robin Hood. ‘Thomas a Becket,’ literally, I doubt
not, ‘Thomas atte Becket’—that is, the streamlet—is
but another instance from more general history.
The name is found in a more Norman dress in the
Hundred Rolls, where one ‘Wydo del Beck’t’ is set
down. In the same way ‘atte-Gate’ became the
jewelled ‘Agate,’ and ‘atte-More’ ‘Amore’ and the
sentimental ‘Amor.’ I have said that where the name
proper—<i>i.e.</i> the word of locality—began with a vowel
the letter ‘n’ was added to ‘atte’ for purposes of
euphony. It is interesting to note how this euphonic
‘n’ has still survived when all else of the prefix has
lapsed. Thus by a kind of prosthesis our familiar
‘Noakes’ or ‘Nokes’ stands for ‘Atten-Oaks,’ that is,
‘At the Oaks.’ ‘Piers Plowman,’ in another edition
from that I have already quoted, makes Covetousness
to say—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For sum tyme I served</div>
      <div class='line'>Simme atte Noke,</div>
      <div class='line'>And was his plight prentys,</div>
      <div class='line'>His profit to look.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Nash’ is but put for ‘atten-Ash,’ or as some of our
Rolls records it, ‘atte-Nash;’ ‘Nalder’ for ‘atten-Alder,’
‘Nelmes’ for ‘atten-Elms,’ ‘Nall’ for atten-Hall,’
while ‘Oven’ and ‘Orchard’ in the olden
registers are found as ‘atte-Novene’ and ‘atte-Norchard’
respectively. That this practice, in a day of
an unsettled orthography, was common, is easily
judged by the traces that may be detected in our
ordinary vocabulary of a similar habit. In the period
we are considering ‘ale’ was the vulgar term for an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>‘ale-house.’ We still talk of the ‘ale-stake,’ that is,
the public-house sign. Thus ‘atten-ale’ got corrupted
into ‘nale.’ Chaucer, with many other writers, so
uses it. In the ‘Freres Tale’ we are told how the
Sompnour—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Maken him gret festes at the nale.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>An old poem, too, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Robin will Gilot</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Leden to the nale</div>
      <div class='line'>And sitten there togedres</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And tellen their tale.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus our forefathers used to talk alike of ‘an ouch,’
or ‘a nouch,’ for a jewel or setting of gold. Gower
has it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When thou hast taken any thynge</div>
      <div class='line'>Of love’s gifte, or nouche, or rynge.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Even now, I need scarcely remind my readers, we
talk of a ‘newt,’ which is nothing but a contraction of
‘an ewt’ or ‘eft,’ and it is still a question whether
‘nedder,’ provincially used for ‘an adder,’ was not
originally contracted in a similar manner. ‘Nale,’ or
‘Nail,’ thus locally derived, still lives in our directories
as a surname.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c009'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>While ‘atte’ has been unquestionably the one
chief prefix to these more familiar local terms, it is
not the sole one that has left its mark. Our ‘Bywaters’
and ‘Bywoods’ are but the descendants of such
mediæval folk as ‘Elias Bi-the-water,’ or ‘Edward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>By-the-wode,’ and our ‘Byfords,’ ‘Bytheseas,’ and
‘Bygates,’ or ‘Byatts,’ are equally clearly the offspring
of some early ancestor who dwelt beside some
streamlet shallow, or marine greensward, or woodland
hatchway.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this pursuit after individuality, however, this
was not the only method adopted. Another class of
names arose from the somewhat contrary practice
of appending to the place-word a termination equally
significative of residence. This suffix was of two
kinds, one ending in ‘er,’ the other in ‘man.’ Thus
if the rustic householder dwelt in the meadows, he
became known among his acquaintance as ‘Robert
the Fielder,’ or ‘Filder;’ if under the greenwood
shade, ‘Woodyer,’ or ‘Woodyear,’ or ‘Woodman’—relics
of the old ‘le Wodere’ and ‘le Wodeman;’ if
by the precincts of the sanctuary, ‘Churcher’ or
‘Churchman’ in the south of England, or ‘Kirker’
or ‘Kirkman’ in the north; if by some priory,
‘Templer’ or ‘Templeman;’ if by the village cross,
‘Crosser,’ or ‘Crossman,’ or ‘Croucher,’ or ‘Crouchman;’
if by the bridge, ‘Bridger’ or ‘Bridgman;’ if
by the brook, ‘Brooker,’ or ‘Brookman,’ or ‘Becker,’
or ‘Beckman;’ if by the well, the immortal ‘Weller,’
or ‘Welman,’ or ‘Crossweller,’ if, as was often the
case, it lay beneath the roadside crucifix; if by some
particular tree, ‘Beecher,’ once written ‘le Beechar,’
or ‘Asher,’ or ‘Hollier,’ or ‘Holleyman,’ or ‘Oker,’
and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>A certain number of names of the class we are
now dwelling upon have arisen from a somewhat
peculiar colloquial use of the term ‘end’ in vogue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>with our Saxon forefathers. The method of its employment
is still common in Lancashire and Yorkshire.
The poorer classes still speak of a neighbour as dwelling
‘at the street end;’ they never by any chance use
the fuller phrase ‘the end of the street.’ Chaucer
uses it as a familiar mode of expression. The Friar,
in the preface to his story, says slightingly—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A Sompnour is a rener up and doun</div>
      <div class='line'>With mandments for fornication,</div>
      <div class='line'>And is beaten at every tounes ende.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the ‘Persones Prologue,’ too, the same poet says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Therewith the moons exaltation</div>
      <div class='line'>In mene Libra, alway gan ascende</div>
      <div class='line'>As we were entring at the thorpes ende.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>How colloquial it must have been in his day we may
judge from the following list of names I have been
enabled to pick up from various records, and which I
could have enlarged had I so chosen:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>John ate Bruge-ende.</div>
      <div class='line'>Walter atte Townshende.</div>
      <div class='line'>John de Poundesende.</div>
      <div class='line'>Margaret ate Laneande.</div>
      <div class='line'>William atte Streteshend.</div>
      <div class='line'>John atte Burende.</div>
      <div class='line'>Adam de Wodeshende.</div>
      <div class='line'>Martin de Clyveshende.</div>
      <div class='line'>John de la Wykhend.</div>
      <div class='line'>William de Overende.</div>
      <div class='line'>John de Dichende.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thomas atte Greaveshende.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Besides these we have such a Latinized form for
‘Townsend,’ or ‘Townshend,’ as ‘Ad finem villæ,’ or
‘End’ itself without further particularity, in such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>sobriquet as ‘William atte-Nende.’<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c009'><sup>[108]</sup></a> The several
points of the compass, too, are marked in ‘Northende,’
‘Eastende,’ and ‘Westende,’ the latter having
become stereotyped in the fashionable mouth as the
quarter in which the more opulent portion of the town
reside, whether its aspect be towards the setting sun
or the reverse—but an exaggeration of this kind is a
mere trifle where fashion is concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>But these Saxon compounded names, numerous
as they are, are but few in comparison with the simple
locative itself, without prefix, without desinence,
‘Geoffrey atte Style,’ ‘Roger atte Lane,’ ‘Walter atte
Water,’ ‘Thomas atte Brooke;’ or in the more
Norman fashion of many of our rolls, ‘John de la
Ford,’ ‘Robert del Holme,’ ‘Richard de la Field,’
‘Alice de la Strete:’ all these might linger for awhile,
but in the end, as we might foresee, as well in the
mouths of men as later on in the pages of our registers,
they became simple ‘Geoffrey Styles’ and ‘Roger
Lane,’ ‘Walter Waters’ and ‘Thomas Brookes,’ ‘John
Ford’ and ‘Robert Holmes,’ ‘Alice Street’ and
‘Richard Field.’ Here, then, is an endless source of
surnames to our hands. Here is the spring from
which have issued those local sobriquets which preponderate
so largely over those of every other class. To
analyse all these were impossible, and the task of
selection is little less difficult. But we may give the
preference to such leading provincialisms as are embodied
in our personal nomenclature, or to such terms
as by their existence there betoken that, though not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>now, yet they did then occupy a place in the vocabulary
of every-day converse. For it is wonderful how
numberless are the local words, now obsolete saving
for our registers, which were used in ordinary talk not
more than five hundred years ago. That many of
them have been thus rescued from oblivion by our
hereditary nomenclature is due no doubt to the fact
that the period of the formation of the latter is that
also during which our tongue was settling down into
that composite form of Saxon and Norman in which
we now have it, and which in spite of losses in consequence,
in spite of here and there a noble word
crushed out, has given our English language its
pliancy and suppleness, its strengths and shades.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have mentioned ‘de la Woode’ and Attewoode.’
‘De la Hirst’ is exactly similar—its compounds
equally numerous. The pasture beside it is
‘Hursley’—if filberts abound it is ‘Hazlehurst;’ if
ashes, ‘Ashurst;’ if lindens or linds, ‘Lyndhurst;’ if
elms, ‘Elmhurst.’ If hawks frequented it we find it
styled ‘Hawkhurst;’ if goats, ‘Goathirst;’ if badgers
or brocks, ‘Brocklehurst;’ if deer, ‘Dewhurst’ (spelt
Duerhurst, 1375). The ‘holt’ was less in size, being
merely a coppice or small thicket. Chaucer speaks
of ‘holtes and hayes.’ ‘De la Holt’ is of frequent
occurrence in our early rolls. Our ‘Cockshots’ are
but the ‘cocksholt,’ the liquid letter being elided as in
‘Aldershot,’ ‘Oakshot,’<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c009'><sup>[109]</sup></a> and ‘Bagshot,’ or badgers’
holt. A ‘shaw’ or ‘schaw’ was a small woody
shade or covert. An old manuscript says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>In somer when the shawes be sheyne,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And leves be large and long,</div>
      <div class='line'>It is fulle mery in feyre foreste</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To here the foulys song.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>As a shelter for game and the wilder animals, it is
found in such compounds as ‘Bagshaw,’ the badger
being evidently common; ‘Hindshaw,’ ‘Ramshaw,’
‘Hogshaw,’<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c009'><sup>[110]</sup></a> ‘Cockshaw,’ ‘Henshaw,’ and ‘Earnshaw.’
The occurrence of such names as ‘Shallcross’ and
‘Shawcross,’ ‘Henshall’ and ‘Henshaw,’ and ‘Kersall’
and ‘Kershaw,’ would lead us to imagine that this
word too has been somewhat corrupted. Other
descriptive compounds are found in ‘Birkenshaw,’
or ‘Denshaw,’ or ‘Bradshaw,’ or ‘Langshaw,’ or
‘Openshaw.’ As for ‘Shaw’ simple, every county in
England has it locally, and every directory surnominally.
Such a name as ‘Richard de la Frith’ or
‘George ate Frith’ carries us at once to the woodland
copses that underlay our steeper mountain-sides—they
represented the wider and more wooded valleys
in fact. We find the term lingering locally in such
a name as ‘Chapel-en-le-frith’ in the Peak of Derbyshire.
The usual alliterative expression of early days
was ‘by frith and fell.’ We have it varied in an old
poem of the fourteenth century:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Duke of Braband first of all</div>
      <div class='line'>Swore, for thing that might befall,</div>
      <div class='line'>That he should both day and night</div>
      <div class='line'>Help Sir Edward in his right,</div>
      <div class='line'>In town, in field, in frith and fen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Friths’ are by no means in danger of obsoletism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>to judge by our directories—and they are a pleasant
memorial of a term which was once in familiar use as
expressive of some of the most picturesque portions of
English scenery. Such a name as ‘De la Dene’ or
‘Atte Den,’ of frequent occurrence formerly, and as
‘Dean’ or ‘Den’ equally familiar now, is worthy of
particularity. A den was a sunken and wooded vale,
where cattle might find alike covert and pasture.
Thus it is that we are accustomed to speak of a den
in connexion with animal life, in such phrases as a
‘den of lions’ or a ‘den of thieves.’ See how early
this notion sprang. We have a remembrance of the
brock in ‘Brogden,’ the wolf in ‘Wolfenden,’ the fox
in ‘Foxden,’ the ram in ‘Ramsden,’ the hare in ‘Harden,’
and the deer in ‘Dearden,’<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c009'><sup>[111]</sup></a> ‘Buckden’ or ‘Bugden,’
‘Rayden’ and ‘Roden,’ or ‘Rowden.’ The more
domesticated animals abide with us in ‘Horsden,’
‘Oxenden,’ and ‘Cowden,’ ‘Lambden,’ or ‘Lamden,’
‘Borden,’ and ‘Sugden,’ or ‘Sowden;’ ‘Swinden,’
‘Eversden,’ and ‘Ogden,’ at first written ‘de Hogdene.’
With regard especially to this latter class it is
that our ‘Court of Dens’ arose, which till late years
settled all disputes relative to forest pannage. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>dweller therein, engaged probably in the tendance of
such cattle as I have mentioned last, was the ‘Denyer’
or ‘Denman,’ both surnames still living in our midst.
While the <i>den</i> was given up mainly to swine, the <i>ley</i><a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c009'><sup>[112]</sup></a>
afforded shelter to all manner of domestic livestock,
not to mention, however, some few of the wilder
quarry. The equine species has given to us ‘Horsley;’
the bovine, ‘Cowley,’ ‘Kinley,’ and ‘Oxlee’ or
‘Oxley;’ the deer, ‘Hartley,’ ‘Rowley,’ ‘Buckley,’
and ‘Hindley;’ the fox, ‘Foxley;’<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c009'><sup>[113]</sup></a> the hare, ‘Harley,’
and even the sheep, though generally driven to
the scantier pastures of the rocks and steeps, has left
us in ‘Shipley’ a trace of its footprint in the deeper
and more sheltered glades. Characteristic of the
trees which enclosed it, we get ‘Ashley,’ ‘Elmsley,’
‘Oakley,’ ‘Lindley,’ or ‘Berkeley.’ Of the name
simple we have endless forms; those of ‘Lee,’ ‘Legh,’
‘Lea,’ ‘Lees,’ ‘Laye,’ and ‘Leigh’<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c009'><sup>[114]</sup></a> being the most
familiar. In the old rolls their ancestors figure in an
equal variety of dresses, for we may at once light
upon such names as ‘Emma de la Leye,’ or ‘Richard
de la Legh,’ or ‘Robert de la Lee,’ or ‘William de la
Lea,’ or ‘Petronilla de la Le.’ Our ‘Atlays’ and
‘Atlees,’ as I have already said, are but the more
Saxon ‘Atte Lee.’</p>

<p class='c007'>In some of these surnames we can trace the early
cuttings amongst the thickly wooded districts where
the larger wealds were situated. Our ‘Royds,’ or
‘Rodds,’ or ‘Rodes,’ all hail from some spot <i>ridded</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of waste wood. Compounds may be found in our
‘Huntroyds,’ that is, the clearing for the chase; ‘Holroyds,’
that is, the holly-clearing; and ‘Acroyds,’ that
is, the oak-clearing, the term ‘acorn,’ that is, ‘oak-corn,’
and such local names as ‘Acton’ or ‘Acland,’
reminding us of this the older spelling; ‘Ormerod,’
again, is but Ormes-clearing—Orme being, as we have
already shown, a common Saxon personal name. Our
‘Greaves’ and ‘Graves’ and ‘Groves,’ descendants of
the ‘de la Groves’ and ‘Atte Groves’ of early rolls,
not to mention the more personal ‘Grover’ and
‘Graver,’ convey the same idea. A ‘Greave’ was
a woodland avenue, graved or cut out of the forest.
Fairfax speaks of the—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wind in holts and shady greaves.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>’Tis true we only ‘grave’ in stone now, but it was not
always so. Thus in the ‘Legend of Good Women’
mention is made of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in11'>A little herber that I have</div>
      <div class='line'>That benched was on turves fresh ygrave.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We still call the last resting-place of the dead in our
churchyards a <i>grave</i>, though dug from the soil. I
have already mentioned ‘de la Graveshend’ occurring
as a surname. Our ‘Hargreaves’ hail from the grove
where the hares are plentiful; our ‘Congreves’ representing
the same in the coney. Our ‘Greeves’ we
shall have occasion in another chapter to show belong
to another and more occupative class of surnames.
Our ‘Thwaites,’ too, belong to this category. Locally
the term is confined to Cumberland and the north,
where the Norwegians left it. It is exactly equivalent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>to ‘field,’ a <i>felled</i> place, or woodland clearing. The
compounds formed from it are too numerous to wade
through. Amongst others, however, we have, as
denotive of the substances ridded, ‘Thornthwaite,’
‘Limethwaite,’ ‘Rownthwaite,’ and ‘Hawthornthwaite;’
of peculiarity in position or shape, ‘Brathwaite’
(broad), and ‘Micklethwaite;’ of contents,
‘Thistlethwaite,’ ‘Cornthwaite,’ and ‘Crossthwaite.’
The very dress of the majority of these compounds
testifies to the northern origin of the root-word.</p>
<p class='c007'>Our ‘Slade’ represents the ‘de la Slades’ of the
Hundred Rolls. A slade was a small strip of green
plain within a woodland. One of the numberless
rhymes concerning Robin Hood says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It had been better of William a Trent</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To have been abed with sorrowe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than to be that day in the greenwood slade</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To meet with Little John’s arrowe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Its nature is still more characterised in ‘Robert de
Greneslade,’ that is, the green-slade; ‘William de la
Morslade,’ the moorland-slade; ‘Richard de Wytslade,’
the white-slade; ‘Michael de Ocslade,’ the
oak-slade, and ‘William de Waldeslade,’<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c009'><sup>[115]</sup></a> the forest-slade
(weald); ‘Sladen,’ that is, slade-den, implies a
woodland hollow. As a local term there is a little
difference betwixt it and ‘launde,’ only the latter has
no suspicion of indenture about it. A launde was a
pretty and rich piece of grassy sward in the heart of
a forest, what we should now call an open wood, in
fact. Thus it is we term the space in our gardens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>within the surrounding shrubberies <i>lawns</i>. Chaucer
says of Theseus on hunting bent—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To the <i>launde</i> he rideth him ful right</div>
      <div class='line'>There was the hart wont to have his flight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the ‘Morte Arthur,’ too, we are told of hunting—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>At the hartes in these hye <i>laundes</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This is the source of more surnames than we might
imagine. Hence are sprung our ‘Launds,’ ‘Lands,’
‘Lowndes,’ ‘Landers,’ in many cases, and our obsolete
‘Landmans.’ The forms, as at first met with, are
equally varied. We have ‘atte-Lond,’ ‘de la Laund,’
and ‘de la Lande,’ while the origin of our ‘Lunds’
shows itself in ‘de la Lund.’ ‘De la Holme’ still
flourishes in our ‘Holmes,’ while the more personal
form is found in our ‘Holmers’ and ‘Holmans.’ An
holm was a flat meadow-land lying within the windings
of some valley stream. Our ‘Platts,’ found in
such an entry as ‘Robert del Plat,’ are similarly
sprung, but in the ‘plat’ there was less thought of
general surroundings. As an adjective it was in
common use formerly. For instance, in the ‘Romaunt
of the Rose,’ when the God of Love had shot
his arrow, it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When I was hurte thus in stound</div>
      <div class='line'>I fell down plat unto the ground.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Knowles,’ ‘Knowlers,’ and ‘Knowlmans’ carry
us to the gently rising slopes in the woods, grassy and
free of timber, the old form of the first being ‘de la
Cnolle’ or ‘atte Knolle.’ Our ‘Lynches,’ once written
‘de Linches,’ I should surmise, are but a dress of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>still familiar <i>link</i> across our northern border—the flatland
running by the river and sea-coast, while our
‘Kays’ (when not the old British ‘Kay’) represent
the more artificial ‘quay,’ reminding us of the knitting
together of beam and stone. It is but the same word
as we apply to locks, the idea of both being that of
securing or fastening.</p>
<p class='c007'>Though it is to the more open plains and woodlands
we must look for the majority of our place-names,
nevertheless, looking up our steeps and into
the fissures of the hills, we may see that every feature
in the landscape has its memorial in our nomenclature.
‘De la Hill’ needs no remark. ‘De la Helle’ and
‘atte Helle’ are somewhat less pleasant to look upon,
but they are only another form of the same. ‘De la
Hulle,’ again, is but a third setting of the same.
Gower says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Upon the hulles hyhe</div>

      <div class='line'>And eke of three hulles mo</div>
      <div class='line'>She fond and gadreth herbes sweet.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Mountain’ is the ‘de la Montaigne’ of the twelfth
century, but of course of Norman introduction. This
sobriquet reminds us of the story told of a certain Dr.
Mountain, chaplain to Charles II., who, when the
king asked him if he could recommend him a suitable
man for a vacant bishopric, is reported to have answered,
‘Sire, if you had but the faith of a grain of
mustard seed, the matter could be settled at once.’
‘How?’ inquired the astonished monarch. ‘Why,
my liege, you could then say unto this <i>mountain</i>
(smiting his own breast), “be thou removed to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span><i>see</i>,” and it should be done.’<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c009'><sup>[116]</sup></a> Our ‘Cloughs’ represent
the narrow fissures betwixt the hills. From the
same root we owe our ‘Clives’ (the ‘de la Clive’ of
the Hundred Rolls), ‘Cliffes,’ ‘Cleves,’ and ‘Clowes,’
not to mention our endless ‘Cliffords,’ ‘Cliftons,’
‘Clifdens,’ ‘Cliveleys,’ ‘Clevelands,’ ‘Tunnicliffes,’
‘Sutcliffes,’ ‘Nethercliffes,’ ‘Topliffs,’ ‘Ratcliffes,’ or
‘Redcliffes,’ ‘Faircloughs,’ and ‘Stonecloughs.’ Any
prominence of rock or earth was a ‘cop,’ or ‘cope,’
from the Saxon ‘cop,’ a head.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c009'><sup>[117]</sup></a> Chaucer talks of
the ‘cop of the nose.’ In Wicklyffe’s version of
Luke iv. 29, it says, ‘And thei risen up and droven
him out withouten the cytee, and ledden him to
the coppe of the hill on which their cytee was
bilded to cast him down.’ We still talk of a <i>coping</i>-stone.
Hence, from its local use, we have derived
our ‘Copes’ and ‘Copps,’ ‘Copleys’ and ‘Copelands,’
and ‘Copestakes.’ From ‘cob,’ which is but another
form of the same word, we get our ‘Cobbs,’ Cobhams,’
‘Cobwells,’ ‘Cobdens,’ and ‘Cobleys.’ Thus,
to consult the Parliamentary Writs alone, we find
such entries as ‘Robert de Cobbe,’ ‘Reginald de
Cobeham,’ ‘John de Cobwell,’ or ‘Godfrey de Coppden.’
As a cant term for a rich or prominent man
‘cob’ is found in many of our later writers, and
‘cobby’ more early implied a headstrong nature.
Another term in use for a local prominence was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>‘ness,’ or ‘naze.’ ‘Roger atte Ness’ occurs in the
thirteenth century; and ‘Longness’ and ‘Thickness’
and ‘Redness’ are but compounds, unless, as is quite
possible, they be from the same root in its more personal
relationship to the human face, the word <i>nose</i>
being familiarly so pronounced at this time. Our
‘Downs’ and ‘Dunns,’ when not sprung from ‘le
Dun,’ are but descendants of the old ‘de la Dune,’ of
the hilly slopes; our ‘Combs’ and ‘Combes’ representing
the ‘de la Cumbe’ of the ridgy hollows, or
‘cup-shaped depressions’ of the higher hillsides, as
Mr. Taylor happily expresses it. It is thus we get
our terms ‘honeycomb,’ ‘cockscomb,’ ‘haircomb,’ &amp;c.
Few terms have connected themselves so much as
this with the local nomenclature of our land, and few
have made themselves so conspicuous in our directories.
The writer I have just mentioned quotes a
Cumberland poet, who says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There’s Cumwhitton, Cumwhinton, Cumranton,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>But nin wi’ Cumdivock can match.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Of those compounds which have become surnames we
cannot possibly recite all, but among the more common
are ‘Thorncombe’ and ‘Broadcombe,’ ‘Newcombe’
and ‘Morcombe,’ ‘Lipscombe’ and ‘Woolcombe,’
‘Withecombe’ and ‘Buddicom,’ and ‘Slocombe.’
We have already mentioned ‘Amore.’ The
simple ‘More,’ or ‘Moore,’ is very familiar; ‘atte
Mor,’ or ‘de la More,’ being the older forms. This
has ever been a favourite name for punning rhymes.
In the ‘Book of Days,’ several plays of this kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>have been preserved. When Dr. Manners Sutton<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c009'><sup>[118]</sup></a>
succeeded Dr. Moore in the Archiepiscopal chair of
Canterbury, the following lines were written:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What say you?—the archbishop’s dead?</div>
      <div class='line'>A loss, indeed! Oh, on his head</div>
      <div class='line in2'>May Heaven its blessings pour!</div>
      <div class='line'>But if with such a heart and mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>In <i>Manners</i> we his equal find,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Why should we wish for <i>More</i>?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>When Sir Thomas More was Chancellor, it is said, his
great attention to his duties caused all litigation to
come to an end in the Court of Chancery. The following
epigram bearing upon this fact was written:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When More some years had Chancellor been,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>No more suits did remain;</div>
      <div class='line'>The same shall never more be seen</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Till <i>More</i> be there again.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Our ‘Heaths’ explain themselves, but our
‘Heths,’ though the same, and from the first found as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>‘atte Heth,’ are not so transparent. Some might be
tempted to set them down in a more Israelitish category
as descendants of the ‘children of Heth,’ but
such is not the case. Somewhat similar to ‘Cope,’
mentioned above, was ‘Knop’ or ‘Knap’—a summit.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c009'><sup>[119]</sup></a>
Any protuberance, whatever it might be, was with our
old writers a ‘<i>knop</i>.’<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c009'><sup>[120]</sup></a> Rose-buds and buttons alike,
with Chaucer, are ‘<i>knops</i>’:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Among the knops I chose one</div>
      <div class='line'>So fair, that of the remnant none</div>
      <div class='line'>Ne praise I halfe so wel as it.</div>

<p class='c017'>North in his Plutarch says, ‘And both these rivers
turning in one, carrying a swift streame, doe make the
knappe of the said hill very strong of its situation to
lodge a camp upon.’ To our hilltops, then, it is we
owe our ‘Knaps,’ ‘Knappers,’ ‘Knapmans,’ ‘Knopps,’
‘Knopes,’ ‘Knabwells,’ and ‘Knaptons.’ Our ‘Howes’
represent the smaller hills, while still less prominent
would be the abodes of our early ‘Lawes,’<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c009'><sup>[121]</sup></a> and
‘Lowes,’ or ‘de la Lawe’ and ‘de la Lowe,’ as they
are found in the Hundred Rolls. Our ‘Shores’ need
no explanation, but our ‘Overs’ are less known. An
old poem, quoted by Mr. Halliwell, says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>She come out of Sexlonde,</div>

      <div class='line'>That stondes upon the sees overe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It seems to have been used generally to denote
the flat-lands that lay about the sea-coast or rivers
generally—what we should call in Scotland the links.
I have already mentioned our ‘Overends’ as similar
to our ‘Townsends;’ ‘Overman’ doubtless is but the
more personal form of the same.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c009'><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Coming gradually to more definite traces of
human habitation, we may mention some of our tree
names. Of several, such as ‘Nash,’ and ‘Nalder,’ and
‘Nokes,’ we have already spoken. Such a name as
‘Henry atte Beeche,’ or ‘Walter de la Lind,’ or
‘Richard atte Ok,’ now found as simple ‘Beech,’ and
‘Lind,’ and ‘Oake,’ reminds us that we are not without
further obligations to the tree world. Settling
by or under the shade of some gigantic elm or oak, a
sobriquet of this kind would be perfectly natural. As
our ‘Lyndhursts’ and ‘Lindleys’ prove, ‘lind’ was
once familiarly used for our now fuller ‘linden.’ Piers
Plowman says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Blisse of the briddes</div>
      <div class='line'>Broughte me aslepe,</div>
      <div class='line'>And under a lynde</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon a launde</div>
      <div class='line'>Leaned I.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Were the Malvern dreamer describing poetically the
birth and the origin of the future Swedish nightingale
who four hundred years afterwards was to entrance
the world with her song, he could not have been more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>happy in his expression. Our ‘Ashes’ and ‘Birches,’
once ‘de la Byrche,’ need little remark, but ‘Birks,’
the harder form of the latter, is not so familiar, though
it is still preserved in such names as ‘Birkenhead,’ or
‘Birkenshaw,’ or ‘Berkeley.’ A small group of trees
would be equally perspicuous. Thus have arisen our
‘Twelvetrees,’ and ‘Fiveashes,’ and ‘Snooks,’ a mere
corruption of the Kentish ‘Sevenoaks.’ Mr. Lower
mentions ‘Quatrefages,’ that is, ‘four beeches,’ as a
corresponding instance in French nomenclature.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c009'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A common object in the country lane or by-path
would be the gate or hatch that ran across the road
to confine the deer. The old provincialism for this
was ‘yate.’ We are told of Griselda in the ‘Clerkes
Tale’ that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With glad chere to the yate</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

<p class='c017'>and Piers Plowman says our Lord came in through</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Yates,’ written once ‘Atte Yate,’ by their numbers
can bear testimony to the familiarity with which
this expression was once used. ‘Byatt’ I have just
shown to be the same as ‘Bygate,’ and ‘Woodyat’ is
but equivalent to ‘Woodgate.’ Other compounds are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>found in the old registers. In the ‘Placitorum’ of
the thirteenth century, for instance, we light upon
a ‘Christiana atte Chircheyate,’ and a ‘John atte
Foldyate;’ while in the Hundred Rolls of the same
period we find a ‘Walter atte Lideyate,’ now familiarly
known to us as ‘Lidgate.’ Our ‘Hatchs,’ once enrolled
as ‘de la Hache,’ like our before-mentioned
‘Hatchers’ and ‘Hatchmans,’ represented the simple
bar that ran athwart the woodland pathway. We
still call the upper-deck with its crossbars the hatches,
and a weir is yet with the country folk a hatch.
Chaucer speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lurking in hernes and in lanes blinde.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Any nook or corner of land was with our forefathers
a ‘hearne,’ and as ‘en le Herne’ or ‘atte Hurne’ the
surname is frequently found in the thirteenth century.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c009'><sup>[125]</sup></a>
‘De la Corner’ is, of course, but a synonymous term.
A passage betwixt two houses, or a narrow defile between
two hillsides, was a ‘gore,’ akin, we may safely
say, to ‘gorge.’ Our ‘Gores,’ as descendants of the
old ‘de la Gore,’ are thus explained. ‘De la Goreway,’
which once existed, is now, I believe, obsolete.
One of the most fertile roots of nomenclature was the
simple roadside ‘cross’ or ‘crouch,’ the latter old
English form still lingering in our ‘crutched’ or
‘crouched Friars.’ Langland describes a pilgrim as
having ‘many a crouche on his cloke;’ <i>i.e.</i> many a
mark of the cross embroidered thereon. A dweller
by one of these wayside crucifixes would easily get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the sobriquet therefrom, and thus we find ‘atte
Crouch’ to be of early occurrence. Our ‘Crouchmans’
and ‘Crouchers’ I have already mentioned.
A ‘Richard Crocheman’ is found in the Hundred
Rolls, and a ‘William Croucheman’ in another entry
of the same period. As for the simpler ‘Cross,’ once
written ‘atte Cross,’ it is to be met with everywhere.
‘Crosier’ and ‘Crozier’ I shall, in my next chapter,
show to be official rather than local; so we may pass
them by for the present. The more Saxon ‘Rood’
or ‘Rudd’ is not without its representatives. ‘Margery
atte Rudde’ is found in the ‘Placitorum,’ and
our ‘Rudders’ and ‘Ruddimans,’ I doubt not, stand
for the more directly personal form. Talking of
crosses, we may mention, in passing, our ‘Bellhouses,’
not unfrequently found as ‘atte Belhus’ or ‘de la
Belhuse.’ The founder of this name dwelt in the
small domicile attached to the monastic pile, and, no
doubt, had for his care the striking of the innumerable
calls to the supply of either the bodily or spiritual
wants of those within. Our ‘Bellows,’ I believe, are
but a modification of this. The last syllable has
undergone a similar change in several other instances.
Thus the form ‘del Hellus’ was but ‘Hill-house,’
‘Woodus’ is but the old ‘de la Wodehouse,’ ‘Stannus’
but ‘Stanehouse’ or ‘Stonehouse,’ ‘Malthus’ but
‘Malthouse,’ and ‘Bacchus’ is found originally as ‘del
Bakehouse.’<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c009'><sup>[126]</sup></a> The old ‘Atte Grene,’ a name familiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>enough without the prefix, may be set beside our
‘Plastows,’ relics of the ‘Atte Pleistowe’ or ‘de la
Pleystowe’ of the period we are considering. The
‘play-stowe’ (that is, ‘playground’) seems to have
been the general term in olden days for the open
piece of greensward near the centre of the village
where the may-pole stood, and where all the sports
at holiday times and wake tides were carried on.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c009'><sup>[127]</sup></a>
Our ‘Meads’ or ‘Meddes’ hail from the ‘meadow,’ or
‘mead.’ ‘Ate Med’ is the early form.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c009'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A ‘croft’ was an enclosed field for pasture. Besides
‘Croft’ it has given us ‘Meadowcroft,’ ‘Ryecroft,’
‘Bancroft’ (that is, <i>bean-croft</i>), ‘Berecroft’ (that
is, <i>barley-croft</i>), and ‘Haycraft’ (that is, <i>hedged-croft</i>).
It seems, however, to have been freely used, also, in
the sense of garth or yard, the enclosure in which, or
by which, the house stood. Thus, in the ‘Townley
Mysteries,’ Satan is represented as calling to the
depraved and vile, and saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Come to my crofte alle ye.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>With the humour of the period, which was ever largely
intermingled in even the most sacred themes, one of
the characters, acting as a demon, replies—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Souls come so thyk now late unto hell</div>
      <div class='line in17'>As ever</div>
      <div class='line'>Our porter at hell-gate</div>
      <div class='line'>Is holden so strait,</div>
      <div class='line'>Up early and downe late,</div>
      <div class='line in17'>He rests never.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>There is little distinction to be drawn between ‘garth’
and ‘yard’ in the North of England, and in reality
there ought to be none. Such names, however, as
‘Nicholas de Apelyerd,’ or ‘Robert del Apelgarth,’
or ‘Richard atte Orcheyerd,’ the descendants of
whom are still in our midst, bespeak a former
familiarity of usage which we cannot find now. We
have just mentioned ‘Haycraft.’ This reminds us of
our ‘Hayes.’ Chaucer, in his ‘Troilus,’ says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But right so as these holtes and these hayes,</div>
      <div class='line'>That han in winter dead been and dry,</div>
      <div class='line'>Revesten them in grene when that May is,</div>
      <div class='line'>When every lusty beast listeth to pley.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>A ‘hay’ was nothing but a ‘hedge.’ In the Hundred
Rolls we find such names occurring as ‘Margery de
la Haye’ or ‘Roger de la Hagh,’ or in a compounded
form ‘Richard de la Woodhaye,’ or ‘Robert de
Brodheye.’ Of the simple root the forms most
common now are ‘Hay,’ ‘Hayes,’ ‘Haighs,’ ‘Haigs,’
and ‘Hawes.’ The composite forms are endless.
‘Roundhay’ explains itself. ‘Lyndsay’ I find spelt at
this period as ‘Lyndshay,’ so that it is not the islet
whereon the lind or linden grows, but the hedge of
these shrubs. Besides these we have ‘Haywood’ or
‘Heywood,’ ‘Hayland’ and ‘Hayley.’ From the
form ‘hawe,’ mentioned above, we have our ‘Hawleys,’
‘Haworths,’ and ‘Hawtons,’ or ‘Haughtons,’
and probably the longest name in the directory, that
of ‘Featherstonehaugh.’ We still talk of the <i>haw</i>-thorn
and haw-haw. Chaucer uses the term for a
farmyard or garth—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And eke there was a polkat in his hawe</div>
      <div class='line'>That, as he sayd, his capons had yslawe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>This at once explains such a name as ‘Peter in le
Hawe’ found in the Hundred Rolls. But Chaucer
has a prettier use of it than this, a use still abiding in
our ‘Churchays,’ relics of the mediæval ‘de Chirchehay.’
He speaks twice of the ‘Churchhawe,’ or graveyard.
How pretty it is! almost as pretty as its
Saxon synonym ‘Godsacre,’ only that is more endeared
to us, inasmuch as since the acre always
denoted the sowed land (Latin ‘ager’), so it whispers
to us hopefully of the great harvest-tide to come when
the seed thus sown in corruption shall be raised an
incorruptible body. Our ‘Goodacres’ are doubtless
thus derived—and with such names as ‘Acreman’ or
‘Akerman,’ ‘Oldacre’ or ‘Oddiker,’ ‘Longacre’ and
‘Whittaker’ (or ‘Whytacre’ or ‘Witacre,’ as I find it
in the thirteenth century), help to remind us how in
early days an acre denoted less a fixed measure of
land than soil itself that lay under the plough. But
this by the way. I have just mentioned ‘Hayworth.’
A name like ‘William de la Worth’ (H.R.) represented
our ‘Worths’ in the thirteenth century. Properly
speaking, any sufficiently <i>warded</i> place—it had
come to denote a small farmstead at the time the
surname arose. ‘Charlesworth’ is the ‘churl’s worth,’
the familiar metamorphosis of this name being identical
with that of the astronomic ‘Charles Wain,’ and
with such place-names as ‘Charle-wood,’ ‘Charlton,’
‘Carlton,’ and ‘Charley.’ Our various ‘Unsworths,’
‘Ainsworths,’ ‘Whitworths,’ ‘Langworthys,’ ‘Kenworthys,’
‘Wortleys,’ and others of this class are
familiar to us all. Surnames like ‘Roger de la
Grange,’ or ‘Geoffrey de la Grange,’ or ‘John le
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Granger,’<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c009'><sup>[129]</sup></a> remind us that <i>grange</i> also was commonly
used at this time for a farmstead, it being in reality
nothing more than our <i>granary</i>.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c009'><sup>[130]</sup></a> Piers Plowman
portrays the good Samaritan thus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His wounds he washed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Enbawmed hym, and bound his head,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ledde hym forth on ‘Lyard’</div>
      <div class='line'>To ‘lex Christi,’ a graunge</div>
      <div class='line'>Wel sixe mile or sevene</div>
      <div class='line'>Beside the newe market.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Barnes,’ I need not say, are of similar origin.
The Celtic ‘booth,’ a frail tenement of ‘boughs,’ whose
temporary character our Biblical account of the
Israelitish wanderings so well helps to preserve, has
given birth to our ‘Booths’ and ‘Boothmans,’ once
written ‘de la Bothe’ and ‘Botheman.’ They may
possibly have kept the stall at the fair or market.
Comparisons we know are ever odious, but set beside
the more Saxon ‘Steads’ and ‘Steadmans’ the
former inevitably suffer. The very names of these
latter betray to us the well-nigh best characteristics
of the race whence they are sprung. To be <i>steady</i>
and <i>sted</i>fast are its best and most inherent qualities—qualities
which, added to the dash and spirit of the
Norman, have given the position England to-day
occupies among the nations of the world. Our
‘Bowers’ and ‘Bowermans,’ when not occupied in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>bowyer’s or bower’s craft, represent the earlier ‘de la
Bore’ or ‘atte Bore,’ and have taken their origin from
the old ‘bower,’ the rustics’ abode. It is the same
word whence has sprung our bucolic ‘boor.’ An old
English term for a house or mansion was ‘bold,’ that
which was <i>built</i>. The old ‘De la Bolde,’ therefore,
will in many cases be the origination of our ‘Bolds.’
Our ‘Halls’ explain themselves, but the older form
of ‘Hale’ (once ‘atte Hale’ or ‘de la Hale’) is not
so easily traceable. ‘De la Sale,’ sometimes also
found as ‘de la Saule,’ was the Norman synonym of
the same.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Soon they sembled in sale,</div>
      <div class='line'>Both kynge and cardinale,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>says an old writer. ‘Sale’ and ‘Saul’ are still extant.
Names still more curious than these are those taken,
not from the residence itself, but from particular
rooms in such residence. They are doubtless the
result of the feudal system, which, with its formal list
of house officers and attendants, required the presence
of at least one in each separate chamber. Hence the
Norman-introduced <i>parlour</i>, that is, the speaking or
reception room, gave us ‘Henry del Parlour,’ or
‘Richard ate Parlour;’ the kitchen, ‘Geoffrey atte
Kitchen,’ or ‘Richard del Kechen;’ or the pantry
‘John de la Panetrie,’ or ‘Henry de la Panetrie.’
But I shall have occasion to speak more fully of this
by-and-by, so I will say no more here.</p>
<p class='c007'>There is a pretty word which has been restored
from an undeserved oblivion within the last few years
by Mr. Tennyson, in his ‘Brook,’ as an idyll perhaps
the distinctly finest thing of its kind in the English
language. The word referred to is ‘thorpe,’ a village,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>pronounced ‘throp’ or ‘trop’ by our forefathers.
Thus in the ‘Clerkes Tale’ we are told—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nought far fro this palace honorable,</div>
      <div class='line'>There stood a thorpe of sight delitable,</div>
      <div class='line'>In which the poor folk of that village</div>
      <div class='line'>Hadden their bestes and their harborage;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>while in the ‘Assembly of Fowls’ mention is prettily
made of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The tame ruddocke and the coward kite,</div>
      <div class='line'>The cock, that horiloge is of thorpes lite.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This diversity is well exemplified in our nomenclature.
Thus the term in its simple form is found in
such entries as ‘Adam de Thorpe,’ or ‘Simon de
Throp,’ or ‘Ralph de Trop,’ all of which are to be
met with in the one same register; while compounded
with other words, we are all familiar with such surnames
as ‘Gawthorpe,’ ‘Winthrop,’ ‘Hartrop,’ ‘Denthorp,’
‘Buckthorp,’ ‘Fridaythorp,’ ‘Conythorp,’ ‘Calthrop,’
or ‘Westropp.’ Our ‘Thrupps,’ too, we must
not forget as but another corrupted form of the same
root.</p>
<p class='c007'>There are two words whose sense has become so
enlarged and whose importance among English local
terms has become so great that we cannot but give
them a place by themselves. They are those of
‘town’ and ‘borough.’ Such registered names as
‘William de la Towne’ or ‘Ralph de la Tune,’ now
found as ‘Town’ and ‘Tune,’ represent the former in
its primeval sense. The term is still used in Scotland,
as it was used here some generations ago, to
denote a farm and all its surrounding enclosures. In
Wicklyffe’s Bible, where we read ‘and went their
ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandize,’ it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>is ‘one into his toun.’ In the story of the Prodigal
Son, too, it is similarly employed—‘And he wente
and drough him to one of the cyteseynes of that
cuntre, and he sente him into his toun to feed swyn.’
Let me quote Chaucer also to the same effect—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Whan I out of the door came,</div>
      <div class='line'>I fast about me beheld,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then saw I but a large field,</div>
      <div class='line'>As farre as ever I might see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without toune, house, or tree.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is thus a name I have already mentioned, ‘de la
Townshende,’ the parent of our ‘Townsends,’ ‘Townshends,’
and ‘Townends,’ has arisen. Another entry,
that of ‘Robert Withouten-town,’ has, as we might
have expected, left no issue. Such names as ‘Adam
de la Bury,’ or ‘Walter atte Bure,’ or ‘John atte Burende’
(the latter now extinct, I fear), open out to us
a still larger mass of existing nomenclature. The
manorial residence is still in many parts of England,
with the country folk, the ‘bury.’ To this or ‘borough’
we owe our ‘Burys,’ ‘Boroughs,’ ‘Borrows,’ ‘Buroughs,’
‘Burkes,’ ‘Broughs,’ ‘Burghs,’ and even ‘Bugges,’ so
that, though Hood has inquired—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in15'>If a party had a voice,</div>
      <div class='line'>What mortal would be a Bugg by choice?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>still the possessors of that not exactly euphonious
cognomen can reflect with pride upon not merely a
long pedigree, but lofty relationships. Another form
of the same word, familiar, too, to early registers, was
‘de la Bere,’ and to this we owe our ‘Berrys,’ ‘Berrimans,’
‘Beers,’ and ‘Beares.’ It is wonderful how the
strict meaning of ‘shelter’ is preserved in all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>terms founded upon its root ‘beorgan,’ to hide. Is it
a repository to guard the ashes of the dead?—it is a
<i>barrow</i>, the act of sepulture itself being the <i>burial</i>.
Is it a refuge for the coneys?—it is a <i>burrow</i>, or <i>beare</i>,
as in ‘Coneybeare.’<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c009'><sup>[131]</sup></a> Is it a raised mound for the
security of man?—it is a <i>bury</i>, <i>borough</i>, <i>brough</i>,
or <i>burgh</i>. How altered now the meaning of these
two words ‘borough’ and ‘town.’ Once but the
abiding-place of a scattered family or two, they are
now the centres of teeming populations. Of these,
while some are still extending their tether, others
have passed the middle age of their strength and
vigour, and from the accidents of physical and industrial
life are but surely succumbing to that dotage
which, as in man so in man’s works, seems to be but
premonitory of their final decay. How true is it that
the fashion of this world passeth away. Even now
this ever restless spirit of change is going on. We
ourselves can scarce tell the spot upon which we were
born. We need not wait for death to find that our
place very soon knoweth us no more, and when we
talk of treading in the footprints of the generations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>that have gone before, it would seem as though it
were but to blind ourselves to the sober and unwelcome
truth that we are rather treading upon the
<i>débris</i> of the changing years.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there is another class of surnames we may
fitly introduce here, which, I doubt not, forms no
small proportion in the aggregate mass of our nomenclature—that
of sign-names. We in a cultivated age
like that of the present fail, as we must, to realize the
effect of these latter upon the current life of our forefathers.
We now pass up and down a street, and,
apart from the aid of the numbered doors and larger
windows, and a more peculiar frontage, above the
door we may see the name of the proprietor and the
character of his occupation in letters so large that it
is literally a fact that he who runs may read them.
But all this is of gradual and slowly developed growth.
The day we are considering knew nothing of these.
It was a time when the clergy themselves in many
cases were unable to read, when such education as a
child of twelve years is now a dunce not to know
would have given then for the possession of like
attainments the sobriquet of ‘le Clerke’ or ‘le Beauclerk.’
And if this was the case with the learned,
what would it be with the lower grades and classes of
society? We may, therefore, well inquire what would
be the use of gilded characters such as we now-a-days
may see, detailing the name of the shopkeeper and
the fashion of his stores? None at all. They could
not read them. Thus we find in their stead the
practice prevailing of putting up signs and symbols
to denote the character of the shop, or to mark the
individuality of the owner. In an age of escutcheons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and all the insignia of heraldry, this was but natural.
All manner of instruments, all styles of dress, all
kinds of ensigns rudely carved or painted, that a
rough or quaint fancy could suggest, were placed in a
conspicuous position by the hatch or over the doorway,
to catch, if it were possible, the eye of the wayfarer.
Even the name itself, when it was capable of
being so played upon, was turned into a symbol
readable to the popular mind. Nor was it deemed
necessary that the device should speak directly of the
trade. Apart from implements and utensils, Nature
herself was exhausted to supply sufficiently attractive
signs; and what with mermaids and griffins, unicorns
and centaurs, and other winged monsters, we see that
they did not stop here—the supernatural also had to
be pressed into this service. The animal kingdom
was, however, specially popular—the hostelries peculiarly
engrossing this class from the fact that they so
often had emblazoned the recognizances of the family
with which they stood immediately connected. Thus
we still have ‘Red Lions’ and ‘White Lions,’ ‘Blue
Boars’ and ‘Boars’ Heads,’ ‘White Bears’ and ‘Roebucks,’
and ‘Bulls’ Heads.’ Relics of the more
special emblems remain in the barber’s pole, to the
end of which a bowl was once generally attached, to
show he was a surgeon also—the pawnbroker’s three
balls, the goldbeater’s mallet, or the shoemaker’s last.
Of the more fanciful we have a capital idea given us
in the lines from Pasquin’s ‘Nightcap,’ written so late
as 1612—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

</div>

<p class='c017'>More than three hundred years previous to this we
find such names figuring in our registers as ‘John
de la Rose,’ ‘John atte Belle,’ ‘Roger Horne,’ and
‘Nicholas Sparewe,’ while ‘Cow’ is met by its Norman
equivalent in the instance of ‘Richard de la
Vache.’ Of the rest, too, contained in the above lines,
all are found in our existing nomenclature with the
exception of ‘Fryingpan.’ Still more recently, the
‘British Apollo’ contained the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I’m amused at the signs</div>
      <div class='line'>As I pass through the town,</div>
      <div class='line'>To see the odd mixture—</div>
      <div class='line'>A ‘Magpie and Crown,’</div>
      <div class='line'>The ‘Whale and the Crow,’</div>
      <div class='line'>The ‘Razor and Hen,’</div>
      <div class='line'>The ‘Leg and Seven Stars,’</div>
      <div class='line'>The ‘Scissors and Pen,’</div>
      <div class='line'>The ‘Axe and the Bottle,’</div>
      <div class='line'>The ‘Tun and the Lute,’</div>
      <div class='line'>The ‘Eagle and Child,’</div>
      <div class='line'>The ‘Shovel and Boot.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>A word or two about these double signs before
we pass on, as I cannot but think much ingenious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>nonsense has been written thereon. There can be no
difficulty in accounting for these strange combinations,
some of which still exist. A partnership in
business would be readily understood by the conjoining
of two hitherto separate signs. An apprentice
who, on the death of his master, had succeeded to his
business, would gladly retain the previous well-established
badge, and simply show the change of hands
by adding thereto his own. I cannot but think that
such ingenious derivations as ‘God encompasseth us’
for the ‘Goat and Compasses,’ or the ‘Satyr and
Bacchanals’ for the ‘Devil and Bag-o’-nails,’ or the
‘Boulogne Mouth’ for the ‘Bull and Mouth,’ are
altogether unnecessary. A clever and imaginative
mind could soon produce similar happy plays upon
the conjunctions contained in the above lines, and
yet the originations I have suggested for them all I
think my readers will admit to be most natural.
There is no more peculiarity about these than about
the ordinary combinations of names we are accustomed
to see in the streets every day of our lives,
denoting partnership. Thus the only difference is
that what we now read as ‘Smith and Wright,’ in an
age when reading was less universal was, say, ‘Magpie
and Crown.’ Partnerships, or business transactions,
often bring peculiar conjunctions of names. So early
as 1284, I find a ‘Nicholas Bacun’ acknowledging a
bond to a certain ‘Hugh Motun,’ <i>i.e.</i> Mutton. (Riley’s
‘London,’ p. 23.) I have myself come across such
combinations as ‘Shepherd and Calvert’—<i>i.e.</i> ‘Calveherd,’
or ‘Sparrow and Nightingale,’ or ‘Latimer and
Ridley.’ During the early portion of my residence at
Oxford the two Bible-clerkships connected with my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>college were in the hands of two gentlemen named
‘Robinson’ and ‘Crusoe.’ They lived on the same
staircase, and their names being (as is customary)
emblazoned above the door, the coincidence was the
more remarkable. ‘Catchem’ and ‘Cheetham’ is said
to have been the title of a lawyer’s firm, but I will
not vouch for the accuracy of the statement. A story,
too, goes that ‘Penn, Quill, and Driver’ once figured
over a scrivener’s office, but this is still more hypothetical.</p>

<p class='c007'>But to return. We may see, from what we have
stated and quoted, that up to a comparatively recent
period the written name seems to have been anything
but customary even in the metropolis. Any one who
will look into a book printed up to the seventeenth
century will see on the titlepage the fact stated that
it was published or sold at the sign of the ‘Stork,’ or
‘Crown,’ or ‘Peacock,’ or ‘Crane,’ as the case might
be. How much we owe to this fashion I need scarcely
say. The Hundred Rolls contain not merely a
‘Henry le Hatter,’ but a ‘Thomas del Hat;’ not
only an ‘Adam le Lorimer,’ but a ‘Margery de
Styrop.’ It is to some dealer in earthenware we owe
our existing ‘Potts,’ some worker in metals our
‘Hammers,’ some carpenter our ‘Coffins,’ once synonymous
with ‘Coffer,’ some osierbinder our ‘Basketts,’
some shoemaker our ‘Lasts,’ some cheesemonger our
‘Cheeses,’ some plowright our ‘Plows,’ some silversmith
our ‘Spoons’ and ‘Silverspoons,’ and some
cooper our ‘Tubbs’ and ‘Cades,’ our ‘Barrills’ and
‘Punshons,’ and so on with endless others. It was
perfectly natural that all these should become surnames,
that the same practice which led to men being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>called in the less populous country by such names as
‘Ralph atte Townsend,’ or ‘William atte Stile,’ or
‘Henry atte Hatch,’ or ‘Thomas atte Nash,’ should
in the more closely inhabited city cause men to be
distinguished as ‘Hugh atte Cokke,’ or ‘Walter de
Whitehorse,’ or ‘John atte Gote’ or ‘de la Gote,’ or
‘Richard de la Vache,’ or ‘Thomas atte Ram,’ or
‘William atte Roebuck,’ or ‘Gilbert de la Hegle,’ or
‘John de la Roe,’ or ‘Reginald de la Wonte’ (weasel).
Our only surprise would be were the case otherwise.
Nevertheless, as we shall see in another chapter, many
of these animal-names at least have arisen in another
manner also.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now we come to what we may term the
second branch of local surnames, that branch which
throws a light upon the migratory habits and roving
tendencies of our forefathers. So far we have touched
upon names implying a fixed residence in a fixed
locality. We may now notice that class which by
their very formation throw our minds upon that which
precedes settlement in a particular spot, viz., removal—that
which speaks to us of immigration. Such a
name in our mediæval rolls as ‘Peter le Newe,’ or
‘Gilbert le Newcomen,’ or ‘Walter le Neweman,’ declares
to us at once its origin. The owner has left his
native village to push his interests and get a livelihood
elsewhere, and upon his entrance as a stranger
into some distant community, alone and friendless,
nothing could be more natural than to distinguish
him from the familiar ‘Peters,’ ‘Gilberts,’ and
‘Walters’ around by styling him as Peter, or
Gilbert, or Walter the ‘New,’ or ‘Newman.’ This it
is which is the origin of our ‘Stranges,’ descendants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>as they are of such mediæval folk as ‘Roger le
Estrange’ or ‘Roger le Straunge.’ There was
‘Roger the Cooper’ and ‘Roger the Cheesemonger’
round the corner close to the market cross, and
‘Roger atte Ram,’ so, of course, this new-comer as
distinguished from them was ‘Roger the Straunge’
or ‘Strange,’ and once so known, the more familiar
he became, the more ‘Strange’ he became, though
this may seem somewhat of a paradox. Thus, too,
have arisen our ‘Strangers’ and ‘Strangemans.’
These, however, are the general terms. To quote a
name like ‘Robert de Eastham’ or ‘William de
Sutton’ is, as it were, to take up the plug from a never-ceasing
fountain. We are thrown upon a list of
sobriquets to which there is no tether. Take up a
subscription paper, look over a list of speakers at a
farmers’ dinner, scan the names of the clergy at a
ministerial conference, all will possess a fair average
of this class of surnames, early wanderers from one
village to another, Saxons fresh escaped from serfdom
seeking a livelihood in a new district, Norman tradesmen
or retainers pushing forward for fresh positions
and fresh gains in fresh fields. It is through the
frequency of these has arisen the old couplet quoted
by Verstigan—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In ‘Ford,’ in ‘Ham,’ in ‘Ley,’ in ‘Ton,’</div>
      <div class='line'>The most of English surnames run.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>There is probably no village or hamlet in England
which has not subscribed in this manner to the sum
total of our nomenclature. It is this which is so telltale
of the present, for while a small rural spot like,
say ‘Debenham,’ in Suffolk, or ‘Ashford,’ in Derbyshire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>will have its score of representatives, a solitary
‘Richard de Lyverpole,’ or ‘Guido de Mancestre,’ or
‘John de Burmyngham’ will be all we can find to
represent such large centres of population as Manchester,
or Liverpool, or Birmingham. Mushroomlike
they sprang up but yesterday, while for centuries
these insignificant hamlets have pursued the even tenor
of their way, somewhat disturbed, it may have been,
from their equanimity four or five centuries agone, by
the announcement that Ralph or Miles was about to
leave them, and who, by thus becoming ‘Ralph de
Debenham’ or ‘Miles de Ashford,’ have given to the
world to the end of time the story of their early
departure.</p>
<p class='c007'>In the same class with the village names of
England must we set our county surnames. These
are of course but an insignificant number set by their
brethren, still we must not pass them by without a
word. In the present day, if we were to speak of a
man in connexion with his county, we should say he
was a Derbyshire or a Lancashire man, as the case
might be. That they did this five or six hundred
years ago is evidenced by the existence of these very
names in our midst. Thus we can point in our
records to such designations as ‘John Hamshire,’ or
‘Adam de Kent,’ or ‘Richard de Wiltshire,’ or
‘Geoffrey de Cornwayle.’ Still this was not the only
form of county nomenclature. The Normans, I suspect
it was, who introduced another. We have still
‘Kentish’ and ‘Devonish’ and ‘Cornish’ to represent
the ‘William le Kentish’s,’ or ‘John le Devoneis’s,’
or ‘Margery le Cornyshe’s,’ of their early rolls; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>our ‘Cornwallis’s’ also yet preserve such fuller forms
as ‘Thomas le Cornwaleys,’ or ‘Philip le Cornwaleys.’</p>

<p class='c007'>We may here mention our ‘Cockins,’ ‘Cockaignes,’
and ‘Cockaynes,’ instances of which are early found.
An old poem begins—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Fur in sea, bi west Spayne,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is a lond ihote Cockaigne.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>There seems to be a general agreement among those
who have studied the subject that our ‘cockney’ was
originally a denizen of this fabled region, and then
was afterwards, from a notion of London being the
seat of luxury and effeminacy, transferred to that city.
A ‘William Cockayne’ is found in the ‘Placitorum’
of Richard I.’s reign, while the Hundred Rolls are yet
more precise in a ‘Richarde de Cockayne.’ Speaking
of London, however, we must not forget our ‘Londonish’s.’
They are but relics of such mediæval
entries as ‘Ralph le Lundreys,’ or ‘William Londonissh,’
either of whom we should now term ‘Londoner,’
one who had come from the metropolis and settled
somewhere in the country. Chaucer in one of his
prose works spells it ‘Londenoys,’ which is somewhat
nearer the modern form. ‘London,’ once simple ‘de
London,’ needs no remark.</p>
<p class='c007'>A passing from one part of the British Empire to
another has been a prolific source of nomenclature.
Thus we find such names as ‘Henry de Irlaund,’
‘Adam de Irland,’ ‘John le Irreys,’ or ‘Thomas le
Ireis,’ in the ordinary dress of ‘Ireland’ and ‘Irish,’
to be by no means obsolete in the present day.
‘Roger le Escot’ or ‘Maurice le Scot’ represents, I
need scarcely say, a surname that is all but interminable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the Caledonian having ever been celebrated for
his roving as well as canny propensities. It is to our
brethren over the Border, too, we owe the more
special form of ‘Inglis,’ known better in the south as
‘English.’ The Hundred Rolls furnish us with such
names as ‘Walter le Engleis,’ or ‘Robert le Engleys,’
or ‘Walter Ingeleys.’ Laurence Minot has the
modern form. Describing Edward III.’s entrance
into Brabant, he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Inglis men were armed wéle,</div>
      <div class='line'>Both in yren and in stele.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The representatives of our native-born Welshmen are
well-nigh as numerous as those across the Scottish
line, and the early spellings we light upon are equally
varied—‘le Galeys,’<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c009'><sup>[133]</sup></a> ‘le Waleys,’ ‘le Waleis,’ and ‘le
Walsshe’ being, however, the commonest. The last
is used by Piers Plowman, who speaks of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Rose the Disheress,</div>
      <div class='line'>Godfrey of Garlekhithe,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Gryfin the Walshe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In these, of course, we at once discern the progenitors
of our ‘Welshs’ and ‘Wallaces.’ ‘Walshman’ is also
found as ‘Walseman.’ ‘Langlois’ seems to be firmly
established in our present midst as an importation
from France. It was evidently returned to us all but
contemporaneously with its rise there, for as ‘L’Angleys’
or ‘Lengleyse,’ it is found on English soil in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>the thirteenth century. It is quite possible that our
‘Langleys’ are in some instances but a corruption of
this name. Thus the different quarters of the British
Empire are well personified so far as our directories
are concerned.</p>
<p class='c007'>We have not quite done with the home country,
however. Our modern ‘Norris’s’ are of a somewhat
comprehensive nature. In the first place there can be
little doubt they have become confounded by lapse of
time with the once not unfamiliar ‘la Noryce,’ or
nurse. Apart from this, too, the term ‘le Noreys’
was ever applied in early times to the Norwegians,
and to this sense mainly it is that we owe the rise of
the name. And yet it has another origin. It was
used in the mere sense of ‘northern,’ one from the
North-country. Thus in the Hundred Rolls we meet
with the two names of ‘Thomas le Noreys’ and
‘Geoffrey le Northern,’ and there is no reason why
these should not both have had the same rise. A
proof in favour of this view lies in the fact that we
have their counterparts in such entries as ‘Thomas le
Surreys’ and ‘Thomas le Southern,’ the latter now
found in the other forms of ‘Sothern’ and ‘Sotheran.’
Nor are the other points of the compass wanting. A
‘Richard le Westrys’ and a ‘Richard le Estrys’ both
occur in the registers of the thirteenth century, but
neither, I believe, now exists. ‘North’ found as ‘de
North’ needs no explanation, and the same can be
said for our ‘Souths,’ ‘Easts,’ and ‘Wests.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The distance from Dover to Calais is not great;
but were it otherwise, we should still feel bound in
our notice of names of foreign introduction first of all
to mention Normandy. For not merely has this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>country supplied us with many of our best family
names, but it enjoys the distinction of having been
the first to establish an hereditary surname. This it
did in the case of the barons and their feudary settlements.
The close of the eleventh century we may
safely say saw as yet but one class of sobriquets,
which, together with their other property, fathers were
in the habit of handing down to their sons. This
class was local, and was attached only to those followers
of the Conqueror who had been presented by
their leader with landed estates in the country they
had but recently subdued. As a rule each of these
feudatories took as his surname the place whence he had
set forth in his Norman home. Thus arose so many
of our sobriquets of which ‘Burke’s Peerage’ is the best
directory, and of which therefore I have little to say
here. Thus arose the ‘de Mortimers’ (the prefix was retained
for many generations by all), the ‘de Colevilles,’
the ‘de Corbets,’ the ‘de Ferrers,’ the ‘de Beauchamps,’
the ‘de Courcys,’ the ‘de Lucys,’ and the ‘de Granvilles.’
Thus have sprung our ‘Harcourts,’ our Tankervilles,’
our ‘Nevilles,’ our ‘Bovilles,’ our Baskervilles,’
our ‘Lascelles,’ our ‘Beaumonts,’ our ‘Villiers,’
our ‘Mohuns,’ and our ‘Percys.’ Apropos of Granville,
a story is told of a former Lord Lyttelton contesting
with the head of that stock priority of family,
and clenching his argument by asserting his to be
necessarily the most ancient, inasmuch as the <i>littletown</i>
must have existed before the <i>grand-ville</i>. A
similar dispute is said to have occurred at Venice
between the families ‘Ponti’ and ‘Canali’—the one
asserting that the ‘Bridges’ were above the ‘Canals,’
the other that the ‘Canals’ were in existence before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the ‘Bridges.’ So hot waxed the quarrel that the
Senate was compelled to remind the disputants that it
had power alike to stop up Canals and pull down
Bridges if they became over troublesome. But to
return: the number of these Norman names was
great. The muster-roll of William’s army comprised
but an item of the foreign incomers. As the tide of
after-immigration set in, there was no town, however
insignificant, in Normandy, or in the Duchies of Anjou
and Maine, which was not soon represented in the
nomenclature of the land. From giving even a partial
list of these I must refrain, however tempted, but see
what the chapelries alone did for us. St. Denys gave
us our ‘Sidneys,’ St. Clair, or Clare, our ‘Sinclairs,’
vilely corrupted at times into ‘Sinkler;’ St. Paul, our
‘Semples,’ ‘Samples,’ ‘Sempills,’ ‘Simpoles,’ and
sometimes ‘Simples;’ St. Lowe, or Loe, our ‘Sallows;’
St. Amand, our ‘Sandemans’ and ‘Samands;’
St. Lis, our ‘Senlis’ and ‘Senleys;’ St. Saviour, our
‘Sissivers;’ St. Maur, our ‘Seymours;’ St. Barbe,
our ‘Symbarbes;’ St. Hillary, our ‘Sillerys;’ St.
Pierre, our ‘Sempers’ and ‘Simpers;’ St. Austin, our
‘Sustins;’ St. Omer, our ‘Somers;’ St. Leger, our
‘Sellingers,’ once more literally enrolled as ‘Steleger,’
and so on with our less corrupted ‘St. Johns,’ ‘St.
Georges,’ and others. I do not say, however, that all
these were later comers. Some of them must undoubtedly
be set among the earlier comrades in arms
of the Conqueror. Indeed it is impossible in every
case to separate the warlike from the peaceful invasion.
Looking back from this distant period, and
with but scanty and imperfect memorials for guidance,
it cannot but be so.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>With respect to another class of these Norman
names, however, we are more certain. Their very
formation seems to imply beyond a doubt that they
had a settlement as surnames in their own arrondissements
before their arrival on English soil. We may,
therefore, with tolerable certainty set them down as
later comers. The distinguishing marks of these are
the prefixes ‘de la,’ or ‘del,’ or ‘du’ attached to them.
Thus from some local peculiarity with respect to their
early homes would arise such names as ‘Delamere,’
‘Dupont,’ ‘Delisle,’ ‘Delarue,’ ‘Dubois,’ ‘Ducatel,’
‘Defontaine,’ ‘Decroix,’ or ‘Deville’ or ‘Deyville.’
This latter is now found also in the somewhat unpleasant
form of ‘Devil.’ They say the <i>devil</i> is the
source of every <i>evil</i>. Whether this extends beyond
the moral world may be open to doubt, but our
‘Evils,’ ‘Evills,’ and ‘Eyvilles,’ from the fact of their
once being written with the prefix ‘de,’ seem to favour
the suspicion of there being a somewhat dangerous
relationship between them.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c009'><sup>[134]</sup></a> These names, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>commonly met with in mediæval records, are, nevertheless,
I say, not to be put down as coeval with the
Conquest, but as after-introductions when England
was securely won. There befell Norman names of
this class, however, what I have shown still more commonly
to have befallen those of a similar, but more
Saxon, category. If these prefixes ‘de la,’ ‘del,’ and
‘du’ are sometimes found retained, they are as often
conspicuous by their absence. Thus while at an early
date after the Conquest we find the Saxon ‘Atwood’
met by the Norman ‘Dubois,’ it is equally true that
they had already to battle with simple ‘Wood’ and
‘Boys’ or ‘Boyce.’ Thus it was we find so early the
Saxon ‘Beech’ faced by the Norman ‘Fail’ or
‘Fayle,’ ‘Ash’ by ‘Freen,’ ‘Frean,’ or ‘Freyne,’
‘Hasell’ by ‘Coudray,’ ‘Alder’ by ‘Aunay,’ and, let
us say, for want of a ‘Walnut,’ ‘Nut’ by ‘Noyes.’ In
the same way our ‘Halls’ or ‘Hales’ were matched
by ‘Meynell’ (mesnil), ‘Hill’ by ‘Montaigne,’ now
also ‘Mountain,’ ‘Mead’ or ‘Medd,’ or ‘Field,’ by
‘Prall’ or ‘Prail,’ relics of the old ‘prayell,’ a little
meadow. I have just set ‘Wood’ by our ‘Boys’ and
‘Boyces.’ To these we must add our ‘Busks,’
‘Bushes,’ ‘Busses,’ all from ‘bois’ or ‘bosc.’ The
‘taillis,’ or underwood, too, gives us ‘Tallis,’ and the
union of both in ‘Taillebois’ or ‘Talboys,’ as we now
have it, combines the names of two of our best church
musicians—‘Tallis’ and ‘Boyce.’ This comparison
of early introduced Norman with names of a Saxon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>local character we might carry on to any extent, but
this must suffice—illustrations and not categories are
all we can pretend to attempt.</p>

<p class='c007'>But these were not our only foreign introduced
names. Coeval with the arrival of these later Norman
designations a remarkable peculiarity began to make
itself apparent in the vast number of names that
poured in from various and more distant parts of the
Continent. That they came for purposes of trade,
and to settle down into positions that the Saxons
themselves should have occupied, is undoubted. The
lethargy of the Saxon population at this period would
be extraordinary, if it were not so easily to be
accounted for. There was no heart in the nation.
The Saxons had become a conquered people, and,
although the spirit of Hereward the Wake was
quenched, there had come that settled sullen humour
which, finding no outlet for active enmity, fed in
spirit upon itself, and increased with the pampering.
To punish open disaffection is easy; to eradicate by
the stern arm of power such a feeling as this is impossible.
Time alone can do it, and that but slowly.
More than a century after this we find Robin Hood
the idol of popular sympathy; no national hero has
ever eclipsed him, and yet, putting sentiment aside, he
was naught but a robber, an outlawed knave. He
was but a vent for the still lingering current of a
people’s feelings. It was but the Saxon and Norman
over again.</p>

<p class='c007'>We can easily imagine, then, if the spirit of the
people was so lethargic as this, at how low an ebb
would be the commercial enterprise of this period.
No country was there whose resources for self-aggrandisement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>were greater than our own—none which had
more disregarded them up to the reign of the third
Edward. Till then she was the mere mine from
which other countries might draw forth riches, the
carcase for the eagles of many nations to feed upon.
Saving the exportation of wool in its raw unmanufactured
state, she did nothing for her national prosperity.
The Dutch cured the fish they themselves
caught on our coasts, and the looms of Flanders and
Brabant manufactured the weft and warp we sent
them into the cloth we wore. If our kings and
barons were clad in scarlet and purple, little had
England actively to do with that; her share in such
superior tints was nought, save the production of the
dye, for in conjunction with the Eastern indigo it was
our woad the Netherlands used. That other nations
were advancing, and that ours was not, is a statement,
commercially speaking, I need not enlarge upon; it is
a mere matter of history which no one disputes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not, however, that there was no trade. Far from
it. Long before Edward III. had established a surer
basis of order and industry, London had become a
mart of no small Continental importance. This outlying
city, as with other towns of growing industry
abroad, had come under the beneficial influence of
the Crusades. So far as the redemption of the Holy
City was concerned, that strong, but noble madness
which had set Christendom ablaze was a failure.
But it effected much in another way. From the first
moment when on the waters of the Levant were
assembled a host as diverse in nation as they were one
in purpose; when in their high-decked galleons and
oar-banked pinnances men met each other face to face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>of whose national existence they had been previously
all but unaware—one result, at least, was sure to
follow—an intercommunion of nations was inevitable,
and, in the wake of this, other and not less beneficial
consequences. Healthy comparisons were drawn,
jealousies were allayed, navigation was improved,
better ships were built, harbours hitherto avoided as
dangerous were rendered safe, and new havens were
discovered. This influence was felt everywhere. It
reached so far as England—London felt it.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was a minor influence—minor in comparison
with our wonderful appliances—minor in comparison
with the commercial spirit developing such Republics
as Genoa and Venice, or the Easterling countries that
border the Baltic and German Seas—a minor influence,
too, especially because the Saxons had so little
share in it. So far as they were concerned, this internationality
was all one-sided. Denizens of all lands
visited our shores, but their visits were unreturned.
What an infinitesimal part of our Continental surnames
in the present day are traceable to English
sources. On the other hand, there was no town however
small, no hamlet however insignificant, in Normandy,
in the Duchies of Anjou and Maine, or protected
by the cities of the Hanseatic League, that is
unrepresented in the nomenclature of our land. Nay,
it was this very lack of reciprocity of commerce that
held out such inducements to the dwellers in other
lands to visit our shores. It was to step into possession
of those very advantages we slighted they came:
we became but a colony of foreign artisans. Truly
our metropolis in those early days of her industry was
a motley community. Numerous names of foreign locality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>have died out in the lapse of centuries between;
a large proportion have become so Anglicized that we
cannot detect their Continental birth, but there is still
a formidable array left in our midst whose lineage is
manifest, and whose nationality is not to be doubted.
We dare not enumerate them all. Let us, however,
take a short tour over Europe and the East. We
will begin with Normandy, and advance westerly, and
then southerly. The provinces that border upon
Normandy and Bretagne, especially to the south and
eastwards, large or small, have, as we should expect,
supplied us with many names. We have besides
‘Norman,’ which, like ‘le Northern,’ is of doubtful
locality, ‘Bret,’ ‘Brett,’ ‘Britt,’ ‘Britten,’ ‘Briton,’
and ‘Brittain,’ from ‘Bretagne,’ and represented in
our olden rolls by such men as ‘Hamo le Bret,’ or
‘Roger le Breton,’ or ‘Thomas le Brit,’ or ‘Ivo le
Briton.’ Our ‘Angers’ are not necessarily so irascible
as they look, for they are but corruptions, as are
‘Angwin’ and ‘Aungier,’ of the ‘Angevine of Anjou.’
Like our ‘Maines’ and ‘Maynes’ from the neighbouring
duchy, they would be likely visitors to our shores
from the intimate relationship which for a while endured
between the two countries through royal
alliances. Our ‘Arters’ and ‘Artis,’ once registered
‘de Artoys,’ came from ‘Artois;’ our ‘Gaskins,’
and more correct ‘Gascoignes,’ from ‘Gascony;’ and
our ‘Burgons’ and ‘Burgoynes’ from Burgundy.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c009'><sup>[135]</sup></a> To
Champagne it is we are indebted for our ‘Champneys’
and ‘Champness’s,’ descendants as they are from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>such old incomers as ‘Robert le Champeneis,’ or
‘Roger le Chaumpeneys,’ while the more strictly local
form appears in our ‘Champagnes,’ not to say some
of our ‘Champions’ and ‘Campions.’<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c009'><sup>[136]</sup></a> Speaking of
Champagne, it is curious that next in topographical
order come our ‘Port-wines,’ sprung from the Poictevine
of Poictou. So early as the thirteenth century,
this name had become corrupted into ‘Potewyne,’ a
‘Pretiosa Potewyne’ occurring in the Hundred Rolls
of that period. More correct representatives are found
in such entries as ‘Henry le Poytevin,’ and ‘Peter le
Pettevin.’ Pickardy has given us our ‘Pickards’ and
‘Pycards,’ Provence our ‘Provinces,’ and Lorraine
our ‘Loraynes,’ ‘Lorraines,’ and ‘Lorings.’ ‘Peter le
Loring’ and ‘John le Loring’ are instances of the
latter form. More general terms for the countrymen
of these various provinces are found in such registered
names as ‘Gilbert le Fraunceis,’ or ‘Henry le Franceis,’
or ‘Peter le Frensh,’ or ‘Gyllaume Freynsman.’</p>

<p class='c007'>I have mentioned ‘Norman’—one of the commonest
of early sobriquets is ‘le Bigod’ and ‘le Bigot.’ Well-nigh
every record has its ‘Roger le Bygod,’ or its
‘William le Bygot,’ or ‘Hugh le Bigot,’ or ‘Alina le
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Bigod.’ Amid the varying opinions of so many high
authorities, I dare not speak in anywise with confidence;
but, judging from these very entries which are
found at an early period, I cannot but think Dean
Trench and Mr. Wedgwood wrong in their conjecture
that the word arose from the ‘beguines’—<i>i.e.</i> the
Franciscans. With Mr. Taylor<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c009'><sup>[137]</sup></a> I am firmly convinced
it is <i>ethnic</i>, and that as such it was familiarly applied
to the Normans I am equally satisfied. In proof of
its <i>national</i> character, Mr. Taylor quotes a passage
from the romance of Gerard of Roussillon—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Bigot, e Provençal e Rouergues,</div>
      <div class='line'>E Bascle, e Gasco, e Bordales.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The popular story ascribes its origin to the fondness
for oaths so peculiar to the Anglo-Norman character,
and in this particular instance to the exclamation
‘by-God.’<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c009'><sup>[138]</sup></a> My own impression is that the origin of
the word has yet to be found. With regard to surnames,
however, I may say that we have at this day
‘Bigots’ in our directories as well as in everything else,
and it is highly probable that our Bagots are but a
corruption of the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turning westward, such names as ‘Michael de
Spaigne,’ or ‘Arnold de Espaigne,’ tell us at once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>who were the forefathers of our ‘Spains’ and ‘Espins;’<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c009'><sup>[139]</sup></a>
while ‘John le Moor’ suggests to us at least the possibility
that English heathlands did not enjoy the entire
monopoly in the production of this familiar cognomen.
The intensive ‘Blackamoor,’ a mere compound of
‘black’ and ‘moor,’ seems to have early existed. A
‘Beatrice Blackamour’ and a ‘William Blackamore’
occur in a London Register of 1417—(Riley’s
‘London,’ p. 647). Nor is Italy void of examples.
The sturdy old republic of Genoa has supplied us
with ‘Janeway’ and ‘Jannaway,’<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c009'><sup>[140]</sup></a> ‘Genese’ and ‘Jayne’
or ‘Jeane.’ Chaucer alludes to the Genoese coin the
‘jane.’ An old poem, too, speaking of Brabant as a
general mart, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Englysshe and Frensh, Lumbardes, Januayes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cathalones, theder they take their wayes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The ‘Libel on English Policy’ has the word in a
similar dress.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Janueys comyne in sondre wyses,</div>

<p class='c017'>Hall, in his Chronicles, speaking of the Duke of
Clarence ravaging the French coast in Henry IV.’s
reign, says, ‘in his retournyng he encountred with
two greate Carickes of Jeane laden with ryche marchandise.’
(f. xxiv.)</p>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Its old rival upon the Adriatic still vies with it in
‘Veness,’ once enrolled as ‘de Venise.’ Rome has
given us our early ‘Reginald le Romayns’ and ‘John
le Romayns,’ whose descendants now write their names
in the all but unaltered form of ‘Romaine,’<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c009'><sup>[141]</sup></a> and to
Lombardy and the Jews we owe Lombard street, and
our ‘Lombards,’ ‘Lumbards,’ ‘Lubbards,’ and perhaps
‘Lubbers’—not to mention our ‘Luckes,’ and ‘Luckies,’
a progenitor of whom I find inscribed in the Hundred
Rolls as ‘Luke of Lucca.’ Advancing eastwards, a
‘Martin le Hunne’ looks strangely as if sprung from
a Hungarian source. Whatever doubt, however, there
may be on this point, there can be none on ‘William
le Turc,’<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c009'><sup>[142]</sup></a> whose name is no solitary one in the records
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and whose
descendants are by no means extinct in the nineteenth.
‘Peter le Russe’ would seem at first sight to be of
Russian origin, especially with such a Christian name
to the fore as the one above, but it is far more probably
one more form of the endless corruptions of
‘le Rous,’ a sobriquet of complexion so extremely
familiar to all who have spent any time over mediæval
registers. I have already mentioned ‘le Norrys’ as
connected with our ‘Norris.’ ‘Dennis,’ I doubt not,
in some cases, is equally representative of the former
‘le Daneys.’ Entries like ‘William le Norris,’ or
‘Walter le Norreis,’ or ‘Roger le Daneis,’ or ‘Joel le
Deneys,’ are of constant occurrence. These, added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>to the others, may be mentioned as bringing before
our eyes the broadest limits of European immigration,
and with scarcely an exception they are found among
the English surnames of to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>But we must not forget the Dutch—a term that
once embraced all the German race.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c009'><sup>[143]</sup></a> ‘Dutchman,’
though I have found no instance in early rolls, is, I
see, a denizen of our present directories, while ‘Dutchwomen,’
found in the fourteenth century, is extinct.
Our ‘Pruces’ are but the old ‘le Pruce,’ or Prussian,
as we should now term them. The word is met with
in an old political song, and, as it contains a list of
articles, the introduction of which into England from
Flanders made the two countries so closely connected,
I will quote it fully:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now beer and bacon bene fro Pruse i-brought</div>

      <div class='line'>Incomen loven beste bacon and beer.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Fleming,’ as our registers prove, was seemingly the
popular term for all the Low Countrymen, bands of
whom were specially invited over by two of our kings
to spread their industry in our own land. Numbers
of them came in, however, as simple wool-merchants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>to transmit the raw material into Holland. As the
old ‘Libel on English Policy’ says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But ye Fleminges, if ye be not wrothe,</div>
      <div class='line'>The grete substance of your cloth, at the fulle,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ye wot ye made it of youre English wolle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>But Flanders was not the only division represented.
Our ‘Brabazons’ once written ‘le Brabançon,’ together
with our ‘Brabants,’ ‘Brabaners,’ and ‘Brabans,’
issued, of course, from the duchy of that name;
while our ‘Hanways’<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c009'><sup>[144]</sup></a> and ‘Hannants’ hailed from
Hainault, the latter of the two representing the usual
early English pronunciation of the place-word. The
old enrolled forms are ‘de Hanoia’ and ‘de Henau.’
It is very likely, therefore, that our ‘Hannahs’ are
similarly derived. The poem I have just quoted,
after mentioning the products of ‘Braban,’ ‘Selaunde,’
and ‘Henaulde,’ proceeds to say:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But they of Holonde at Caleyse buy our felles</div>
      <div class='line'>And our wolles, that Englyshe men then selles.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This, and such an entry as ‘Thurstan de Holland,’
give us at once a clue, if clue were needed, to the
source whence have issued our ‘Hollands.’ Holandman,’
which once existed, is, I believe, now extinct.
A common sobriquet for those enterprising traders
who visited us from the shores of the Baltic was
‘Easterling,’ and it is to their honest integrity as
merchants we owe the fact of their name in the
form of ‘Sterling’ being so familiar. In contrast
to the country-made money, their coin obtained the
name of ‘Easterling,’ or, as we now term it, ‘Sterling’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>money—so many pounds <i>sterling</i> being the
ordinary phrase for good and true coin. We have
even come to apply the term generally in such
phrases as <i>sterling</i> worth, <i>sterling</i> honesty, or
<i>sterling</i> character. The more inland traders were
styled ‘Almaines,’ or merchants ‘d’Almaine,’<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c009'><sup>[145]</sup></a> terms
common enough in our earlier archives, as ‘le Aleman,’
or ‘de Almania,’ or ‘le Alemaund,’ and thus
have sprung our ‘Alemans,’ ‘Almaines,’ and ‘Allmans,’
and through the French, probably, our ‘Lallimands,’
‘D’Almaines,’ ‘Dalmaines,’ and more perverted
‘Dalmans’ and ‘Dollmans.’<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c009'><sup>[146]</sup></a> Thus to these
enterprising and honest traders we owe a surname
which from the odious forms it has assumed shows
that their names, at least, were corruptible, if not their
credit. I ought to have mentioned, though I have no
record to quote in proof of my assertion, that our
‘Hansards’ are, I have no doubt, descendants of such
Hanse merchants in our country as were members of
the Hanseatic League. The founder of the Hansards,
the publishers of the Parliamentary Debates, came
from Norwich in the middle of the last century, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>I need scarcely say that the city was the chief headquarters
of the Flemish weaving interest at the date
we are considering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving Europe for a moment, a name of peculiar
interest is that of ‘Sarson,’<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c009'><sup>[147]</sup></a> or ‘Sarasin,’ a sobriquet
undoubtedly sprung from the Crusades in the East,
and found contemporaneously, or immediately afterwards,
in England as ‘Sarrasin,’ ‘Sarrazein,’ ‘Sarracen,’
and in the Latinized form of ‘Sarracenus.’ The
maternal grandfather of Thomas à Becket was a pure-blooded
Saracen, settled in England. The ‘Saracen’s
Head,’ I need not remind the reader, has been a
popular inn sign in our land from the days of Cœur
de Lion and Godfrey. It would seem as if they were
sufficient objects of public curiosity to be exhibited.
In the ‘Issues of the Exchequer’ of Henry VI.’s
reign is the following:—‘To a certain Dutchman,
bringing with him a Saracen to the Kingdom of
England, in money paid him in part payment of five
marks which the Lord the King commanded to be
paid him, to have of his gift.’ Speaking of the Saracens,
however, we are led to say a word or two about
the Jews, the greatest money-makers, the greatest
merchants, the greatest people, in a commercial point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>of view at least, the world has known. No amount
of obloquy, no extent of cruel odium and persecution,
could break the spirit of the old Israelitish trader.
Driven out of one city, he fled to another. Rifled of
his savings in one land, he soon found an asylum in
another, till a fresh revolution there also caused either
the king or the people to vent their passions and refill
their coffers at the expense of the despised Jew.
‘Jury’ would seem to be a corrupted surname taken
from the land which our Bible has made so familiar
to us. It certainly is derived from this term, but not
the Jewry of Palestine. It was that part of any large
town which in the Early and Middle Ages was set
apart for these people, districts where, if they chose
to face contumely and despite, they could live and
worship together. Every considerable town in
England and the Continent had its Jewish quarters.
London with its ‘Jewry’ is no exceptional case.
Winchester, York, Norwich, all our early centres of
commerce, had the same. Johan Kaye, in his account
of the siege of Rhodes, says: ‘All the strete called
the Jure by the walles was full of their blood and
caren (carrion).’ Our ‘Jurys’<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c009'><sup>[148]</sup></a> are not, however,
necessarily Jews, as it is but a local name from residence
in such quarters, and doubtless at one time or
another during the period of surname establishment
Christians may have had habitation there. ‘Jew,’ on
the other hand, as representing such former entries as
‘Roger le Jew’ or ‘Mirabilla Judæus,’ is undoubtedly
of purely Israelitish descent. But these are not all.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Our early records teem with such names as ‘Roger le
Convers,’ or ‘Stephen le Convers,’<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c009'><sup>[149]</sup></a> deserters from the
Jewish faith. We cannot be surprised at many of the
less steady adherents of the ancient creed changing
their religious status, when we reflect upon the cruel
impositions made upon them at various times.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c009'><sup>[150]</sup></a> I
suspect our ‘Conyers’ have swallowed up the representatives
of this name. Even in the day of its rise we
find it set down in one record as ‘Nicholas le Conners.’</p>

<p class='c007'>So much for general and national names. To
pretend to give any category of the town-names that
have issued from these wide-spread localities were, of
course, impossible. Such sobriquets as ‘Argent,’ from
Argentan; ‘Charters’ and ‘Charteris’ from Chartres;
‘Bullen,’ ‘Bollen,’ or ‘Boleyn’ from Boulogne,<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c009'><sup>[151]</sup></a> with
‘Bulness’ as representative of ‘le Boloneis;’ ‘Landels’
from Landelles; ‘Death’ or ‘D’Aeth’ from Aeth
in Flanders; ‘Twopenny’ from Tupigny in the same
province; ‘Gant’ and ‘Gent’ from Ghent, once ‘de
Gaunt;’ ‘Legge’ from Liege (in some cases at least);
‘Lubbock,’ once written ‘de Lubyck’ and ‘de Lubek,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>from Lubeck in Saxony; ‘Geneve,’ once ‘de Geneve,’
and ‘Antioch,’ once ‘de Antiochia,’ are but instances
taken haphazard from a list, which to extend would occupy
all my remaining space. Many of these are connected
with particular trades, or branches of trades,
for which in their day they had obtained a European
celebrity. If the peculiar manufactures of such places at
home as ‘Kendall’ and ‘Lindsey’ and ‘Wolsey’ have
left in our own nomenclature the marks of their early
renown, we should also expect such foreign cities as
were more especially united to us by the ties of industry
to leave a mark thereof upon our registers.
Such names as ‘Ralph de Arras’ or ‘Robert de
Arraz,’ a sobriquet not yet extinct in our midst, carry
us to Arras in Artois, celebrated for its tapestried
hangings.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c009'><sup>[152]</sup></a> Rennes in Brittany has given birth to our
‘Raines’ and ‘Rains.’<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c009'><sup>[153]</sup></a> Chaucer talks of pillows
made of ‘cloth of raines.’ Elsewhere, too, he makes
mention of ‘hornpipes of Cornewaile,’ reminding us
that in all probability some of our ‘Cornwalls’ hail
from Cornouaile in the same province. Romanee in
Burgundy, celebrated for its wine, has left a memory
of that fact in our ‘Rumneys’ and ‘Rummeys.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Some of my readers will remember that in the ‘Squyr
of low degree’ the king, amongst other pleasures by
which to soothe away his daughter’s melancholy,
promises her,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ye shall have Rumney.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Challens’ are but lingering memorials of the
now decayed woollen manufactures of Chalons, of
which we shall have more to say anon; and not to
mention others, our ‘Roans’ (always so spelt and pronounced
in olden times), our ‘Anvers,’ once ‘de
Anvers,’ our ‘Cullings,’ ‘Cullens,’<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c009'><sup>[154]</sup></a> ‘Collinges,’ and
‘Lyons,’ are but relics of former trades for which the
several towns of Rouen, and Antwerp, and Cologne,
and Lyons, were notorious. The rights of citizenship
and all other advantages seem early to have been
accorded them. In the thirteenth century we find
Robert of Catalonia and Walter Turk acting as
sheriffs, and much about the same time a ‘Pycard’
was Mayor of London.</p>

<p class='c007'>I must stop here. We have surveyed, comparatively
speaking, but a few of our local surnames.
From the little I have been able to advance, however,
it will be clear, I think, that with regard to the
general subject of nomenclature these additional
sobriquets had become a necessity. The population
of England, less than two millions at the period of
the Conquest, was rapidly increasing, and, which is
of far more importance so far as surnames are concerned,
increasing <i>corporately</i>. Population was becoming
every day less evenly diffused. Communities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>were fast being formed, and as circumstances but
more and more induced men to herd themselves
together, so did the necessity spring up for each to
have a more fixed and determinate title than his
merely personal or baptismal one, by which he might
be more currently known among his fellows.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c003' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SURNAMES OF OFFICE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>A class of surnames which occupies no mean
place in our lists is that which has been bequeathed
to us by the dignitaries and officers of
mediæval times. Of these sobriquets, while some
hold but a precarious existence, a goodly number are
firmly established in our midst. On the other hand,
as with each other class of our surnames, many that
once figured in every register of the period are now
extinct. Of these latter not a few have lapsed through
the decay of the very systems which brought them
into being. While the feudal constitution remained
encircled as it was with a complete scheme of service,
while the ecclesiastic system of Church government
reigned supreme and without a rival, there were numberless
offices which in after days fell into desuetude
with the principle that held them together. Still, in
the great majority of cases the names of these have
remained to remind us of their former heyday glory,
and to give us an insight into the reality of those now
decayed customs to which they owed their rise.</p>

<p class='c015'>We must be careful, however, at the outset to
remark that a certain number of these names ought,
strictly speaking, to be set down in our chapter upon
sobriquets. They are either vestiges of the many
outdoor pageantries and mock ceremonies so popular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>in that day, or of the numberless nicknames our forefathers
loved to affix one upon the other, and in
which practice all, high and low alike, joined. For
instance, no one could suspect such a sobriquet as
‘Alan le Pope,’ or ‘Hugh le Pape,’ the source of one
of our commonest and most familiar names, to be
derived from the possessor of that loftiest of ecclesiastic
offices.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c009'><sup>[155]</sup></a> It could be but a nickname, and was
doubtless given to some unlucky individual whose
overweening and pretentious bearing had brought
upon him the affix. So, again, would it be with such
a title as ‘Robert le Keser,’ that is, Cæsar, corresponding
to the French ‘L’empriere’ and the obsolete
Norman ‘le Emperer.’ This is a word of frequent
occurrence in our earlier poets. Langland says of our
Lord, there was</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No man so worthie</div>
      <div class='line'>To be kaiser or king</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the kyngdom of Juda.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Again, he finely says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Death cam dryvynge after,</div>
      <div class='line'>And al to duste passed</div>
      <div class='line'>Kynges and knyghtes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Kaysers and popes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lered and lewed.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c009'><sup>[156]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>This surname, too, is now all but equally common
with the other, being met with in the several shapes
of ‘Cæsar,’ ‘Cayser,’ ‘Cayzer,’ ‘Kaiser,’ and ‘Keyser.’<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c009'><sup>[157]</sup></a>
The name of ‘Julius Cæsar,’ as that of one of our
most esteemed professional cricketers, has only just
disappeared from the annals of that noble game.
The posterity of such enrolled burgesses as ‘William
le Kyng’ or ‘Thomas le Kyng’ still flourish and
abound in our midst. An imperious temperament
would thus readily meet with good-humoured censure.
‘Matilda le Quen’ or ‘Simon Quene’ has not quite
failed of issue; but had it been otherwise, it could
not have been matter for any astonishment, as the
sobriquet was doubtless anything but a complimentary
affix. We must remember that, somewhat curiously,
the old ‘quen,’ or, as the Scotch still term it, ‘quean,’
at once represents the highest rank to which a woman
can reach and the lowest depth to which she can fall.
So would it be once more with our endless ‘Princes,’
and ‘Comtes’ or ‘Counts,’ ‘Viscuntes,’ the heads of
provincial government.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c009'><sup>[158]</sup></a> There is no reason, however,
why our ‘Dukes,’ ‘Dooks,’ or ‘Ducs,’ as they are more
generally found in our rolls (‘Roger le Duc,’ E., ‘Adam
le Duk.’ M.),<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c009'><sup>[159]</sup></a> should not be what they represent,
or rather then represented. A ‘duke’ was of course
anything but what we now understand by the term,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>being then, as it more literally signifies, a leader, or
chieftain, or head. It is thus used in Scripture. Langland,
to quote him again, says of Justice—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A-drad was he nevere</div>
      <div class='line'>Neither of duc ne of deeth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Elsewhere, too, he describes ‘Rex Gloriæ’ as
addressing Lucifer upon the brink of Hades, and
saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Dukes of this dymme place,</div>
      <div class='line'>Anoon undo these yates,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Crist may come in,</div>
      <div class='line'>The kynges sone of hevene.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is in this same category we must set, I doubt not,
such old registrations as ‘Robert le Baron’ or ‘Walter
le Baron,’ ‘John le Lorde’ or ‘Walter le Loverd,’ and
‘Walter le Theyn’ or ‘Nicholas le Then,’ names now
found as ‘Baron,’ ‘Lord,’ and ‘Thain,’ ‘Thaine,’ or
‘Thane.’<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c009'><sup>[160]</sup></a> Even in the case of names of a more ecclesiastic
character, we shall have to apply the same
remark. We have still in our midst descendants of
the ‘le Cardinals’ and ‘le Bishops’ of the thirteenth
century, and there can be little doubt that these were,
in the majority of cases, but nicknames given to particular
individuals by way of ridiculing certain characteristics
which seemed to tend in the direction the
name suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I have already hinted, however, there is another
and equally probable origin for many of the names I
have mentioned. Pageantries and mock ceremonies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>were at this time at the very height of their popularity.
The Romish Church fed this desire. Thus,
for instance, take Epiphany. In well-nigh every parish
the visit of the Magi, always accounted to have been
royal personages, was regularly celebrated. Though
the manner varied in different places, the custom was
more or less the same. There was a great feast, and
one of the company was always elected king, the
rest being, according to the lots they drew, either
ministers of state or maids of honour. Thus Herrick
says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For sports, for pageantrie, and playes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou hast thy eves and holidayes:</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy wakes, thy quintels, here thou hast,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy Maypoles, too, with garlandes graced:</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy mummeries, thy twelfe-tide <i>kings</i></div>
      <div class='line'>And <i>queens</i>, thy Christmas revellings.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c009'><sup>[161]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>I need scarcely say that as popular nicknames these
titles would be sure to cling to the persons upon whom
they had fallen, and that they should even pass on to
their descendants is no more unnatural than in the
case of a hundred other sobriquets we shall have occasion
to recount.</p>
<p class='c007'>Of the rest, however, and, as I have said, maybe
in some of the cases I have mentioned, the surname
was but truly indicative of the office or dignity held.
The Saxon has suffered here. And yet to some this
may seem somewhat strange when we remember how
little change really took place in the institutions of
the Kingdom by the Conquest. The Normans and
Saxons, after all, were but propagations from the
same original stock, and however distant the period
of their separation, however affected by difference of
clime and association, still their customs bore a sufficient
affinity to make coalescence by no means a
difficult task. William was not given to great changes.
He was vindictive, but not destructive. His most
cruel acts were retributive, done by way of reprisal
after sudden disaffection. If a conqueror must establish
his power, deeds of this kind are inevitable.
And even these are exaggerated. The story of the
depopulation of the New Forest, it is now pretty
generally agreed, is impossible—its present condition
forbids of any such act to have been practicable—and
the notion frequently conveyed in our smaller books
of English history, that the curfew was a badge and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>token of servitude, is simply absurd, the fact being
that the same custom prevailed over the whole of
Western Europe, as a mere precaution against fire at
a time when our towns were mainly constructed of
wood. A crushed people will always misinterpret
such ordinances. Prejudice of this kind is perfectly
pardonable. William then, I say, was not inclined to
uproot Saxon institutions. The national council still
remained. The ancient tribunals with their various
motes, the whole system of law which guided the
administration of justice, all was well-nigh as it had
been heretofore. But the language which was the
medium of all this was generally changed. The old
laws were indeed used, but in a translated form—old
officerships still existed, but in a new dialect—the old
policy was mainly upheld, but new terms of police
were introduced. It was not till Edward III.’s reign
that pleadings in the various courts were again carried
on in the English tongue—it was not till Henry VI.’s
reign the proceedings in Parliament were recorded in
the people’s dialect—not till Richard III.’s day its
statutes and ordinances ceased to be indited in
Norman-French. This at once shows the difficulty of
any officership, however Saxon, retaining its original
title. The office was maintained, but the name was
changed. This was the more certain to ensue, so far
as the Church was concerned, from the fact that for a
considerable period all ecclesiastic vacancies were
filled up from abroad. Bishops and abbots were
removed on pretexts of one sort or another, and their
places supplied from the Conqueror’s chaplains. The
monasteries were hived with Normans; the clergy
generally were of foreign descent. It was the same,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>or nearly the same, with regard to civil government.
The lesser courts of judicature were ruled by
foreigners and the foreign tongue. The Barons, as
they retired into the provinces and to the estates
allotted them, naturally bore with them a Norman
retinue. All their surroundings became quickly the
same. Thus the French language was used not
merely in their common conversation—that of course—but
so far as their power, undoubtedly large,
existed, in the provincial courts also.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such entries as ‘Thomas le Shirreve’ and ‘Lena
le Shireve’ remind us not merely of our present
existing ‘Sheriffs,’ ‘Sherrifs,’ and ‘Shreeves,’ but how
firmly this Saxon word has maintained its hold
through the many fluctuations of English government.
The Norman ‘Judge,’ though it is firmly established
in our courts of law, has not made any very great impress
upon our nomenclature. ‘Justice,’ a relic of
‘William’ or ‘Eva le Justice,’<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c009'><sup>[162]</sup></a> is more commonly met
with. Our ‘Corners,’ when not descendants of the
local ‘de la Corners’ of the thirteenth century, are but
corruptions of many a ‘John le Coroner’ or ‘Henry le
Corouner’ of the same period. It is even found in the
abbreviated form of ‘Corner,’ in ‘John le Corner’ and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>‘Walter le Cornur.’ Thus we see that so early as this
our forefathers discerned in the death of a subject a
matter that concerned not merely the well-being of
the crown, but that of which the crown as the true
parent of a nation’s interests was to take cognizance.
More directly opposed to the Norman ‘Judge’ and
‘Justice,’ and in the end displaced by them, were
our Saxon ‘Demer’ and ‘Dempster’ (the older forms
being ‘le Demere’ and ‘le Demester’), they who pronounced
the doom. An old English Psalter thus
translates Psalm cxlviii. 11:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Kinges of earth, and alle folk living,</div>
      <div class='line'>Princes and all <i>demers</i> of land.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>An antique poem, too, has it in its other form in the
following couplet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ayoth was then <i>demester</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Of Israel foure score yeer.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We still employ the term ‘doom’ for judgment.
Chaucer speaks familiarly of one of the Canterbury
company as a ‘Serjeant of the Lawe.’ It is, in the
majority of cases, to the term ‘sergeant’ as used in
this capacity we owe our much-varied ‘Sargants,’
‘Sargeants,’ ‘Sargeaunts,’ ‘Sargents,’ ‘Sergents,’ ‘Sergeants,’
‘Sarjants,’ and ‘Sarjeants.’ The same poet
says of him:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Justice he was full often in assize,</div>
      <div class='line'>By patent and by pleine commission.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Alured le Pledur,’ or ‘Henry le Pleidour,’ and ‘Peter
le Escuzer,’ all obsolete as surnames, need little or no
explanation. Speaking of assizes, we are reminded of
our ‘Sisers’ and ‘Sizers,’ representatives of the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>‘Assizer’—he who was commissioned to hold the
court. Piers Plowman frequently mentions him:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To marien this mayde</div>
      <div class='line'>Were many men assembled,</div>
      <div class='line'>As of knyghts, and of clerkes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And other commune people,</div>
      <div class='line'>As sisours, and somenours,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sherreves, and baillifs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We are here reminded of ‘Hugh le Somenur,’ or
‘Henry le Sumenour,’ now spelt ‘Sumner,’ the sheriff’s
messenger, he by whom the delinquent was brought
up to the court. He was the modern apparitor in
fact. In the ‘Coventry Mysteries’ it is said:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sim Somnor, in haste wend thou thi way,</div>
      <div class='line'>Byd Joseph, and his wyff by name,</div>
      <div class='line'>At the coorte to apper this day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Him to purge of her defame.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>A ‘Godwin Bedellus’ occurs so early as Domesday
record, and as ‘Roger le Bedel,’ or ‘Martin le
Bedel,’ the name is by no means rare somewhat later
on. He was, whether in the forest or any other court,
the servitor, he who executed processes or attended
to proclamations. The modern forms of the name
comprise, among others, ‘Beadell,’ ‘Beadle,’ ‘Beaddall,’
and ‘Biddle.’ Such names as ‘Richard le Gayeler’
or ‘Ada le Gaoler,’ are very commonly met with
in our mediæval rolls. The term itself is of Norman
origin, reminding us that, however menial the duty,
the Saxon could not be entrusted with such an office
as this. We cannot, however, speak of the gaoler and
his <i>confrères</i> without referring to a curious sobriquet
of this period, a sobriquet to which we owe in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>present day our ‘Catchpoles’ and ‘Catchpooles.’<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c009'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
The catchpole was a kind of under-bailiff or petty
sergeant who distrained for debt, or otherwise did the
more unpleasant part of his superior’s work, and was
so called from his habit of seizing his luckless victim
by the hair, or <i>poll</i>, as was the familiar term then. So
general was this nickname that we find it occupying
an all but official place. It is Latinized in our records
into ‘cachepollus,’ a word unknown to Cicero, I
am afraid. In the ‘Plowman’s Vision’ we are told of
the two thieves crucified with the Saviour that:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A cachepol cam forth</div>
      <div class='line'>And cracked both their legges.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Another name for the catchpole was that of ‘Cacherel’
or ‘Cacher,’ both of which forms occur at this same
period as surnames. An old political song says,
murmuringly:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nedes I must spend that I spared of yore</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ageyn this cacherele cometh.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This sobriquet also abides with us still.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c009'><sup>[164]</sup></a> ‘Le Cacher,’
I fear, has been obsolete for centuries.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c009'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Of such as were accountable for duties in the
public streets, we may mention first our ‘Cryers,’
registered at the time we are speaking of as ‘Philip le
Criour,’ or ‘Wat le Creyer.’ He, like the still existing
‘Bellman,’<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c009'><sup>[166]</sup></a> performed a fixed round, announcing in
full and sententious tones the mandates of bench and
council, whenever it was necessary to advertise to the
public such news as concerned their common well-being.
Our <i>policeman</i> may be modern in his name
and in his attire, but as the guardian of the peace, by
night as well as by day, he is but the descendant of a
long line of servants who have in turn fulfilled this
important public trust. His early title was borne by
‘Ralph le Weyte,’ or ‘Robert le Wayte,’ or ‘Hugh le
Geyt,’ or ‘Robert le Gait.’ All these forms are of the
commonest occurrence in our olden registries. By
night he carried a trump, with which to sound the
watches or give the alarm, and thus it was he acquired
also the name of ‘Trumper,’ such forms as ‘Adam le
Trompour’ or ‘William le Trompour’ being frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>met with at this time. To the former title of
this official duty it is we owe the fact of our still
terming any company of night serenaders ‘waits,’ and
especially those bands of strolling minstrels who keep
up the good old custom of watching in Christmas
morn. A good old custom, I say, even though it may
cost us a few pence and rouse us somewhat rudely,
maybe, from our slumbers. ‘Wait,’ ‘Waite,’<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c009'><sup>[167]</sup></a> ‘Wayt,’
and ‘Whaite,’ with ‘le Geyt,’ are the forms that still
exist among us. ‘Trumper,’ too, has its place equally
assured in our nomenclature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such names as we have just dwelt upon, however,
remind us of other municipal authorities, higher in
position than these, to whom, indeed, these were but
servitors. A sobriquet like ‘Richard le Burgess’ or
‘John le Burges’ reminds us of the freemen of the
borough towns, while ‘le Mayor,’ or ‘Mayer,’ or
‘Maire,’ or ‘Mair,’ or ‘Meyre,’<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c009'><sup>[168]</sup></a> or ‘Mire,’ for all
these different spellings are found, is equally suggestive
of the chief magistracy of such. Piers, to quote
him once more, speaks of:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>The maistres,</div>
      <div class='line'>Meirs and Jugges,</div>
      <div class='line'>That have the welthe of this world.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The feminine form of this sobriquet appears in the
early but obsolete ‘Margaret la Miresse.’ Speaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>of mayors, some lines written some years ago on the
proposed elevation of a certain Alderman Wood as
Lord Mayor are not without humour, nor out of place,
perhaps, here:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In choice of Mayors ’twill be confest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our citizens are prone to jest:</div>
      <div class='line'>Of late a gentle ‘Flower’ they tried—</div>
      <div class='line'>November came and checked its pride.</div>
      <div class='line'>A ‘Hunter’ next, on palfrey grey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Proudly pranced his year away.</div>
      <div class='line'>The next, good order’s foes to scare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Placed ‘Birch’ upon the civic chair.</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! this year, ’tis understood,</div>
      <div class='line'>They mean to make a mayor of ‘Wood!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>As a fellow to ‘Meir’ we may cite ‘Provost,’ or
‘Prevost,’ or ‘Provis,’ a term still used of the mayoralty
in Scotland. ‘Councellor’ and ‘Councilman’
are still familiar terms in our midst. ‘Clavenger,’
‘Claver,’ and ‘Cleaver’ we will mention last as filling
up a list of civic offices entirely, so far as the language
is concerned, the property of the dominant
power. A ‘Robert Clavynger’ occurs in the Parliamentary
Rolls. Its root is ‘claviger,’ the key-bearer,’
one whose office it was at this time to protect
the deposits, whether of money or parchments, belonging
to the civic authorities. The more common
term was that of ‘Clavier,’ such entries as ‘Henry le
Claver,’ or ‘John le Clavour,’ or ‘John le Clavier,’<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c009'><sup>[169]</sup></a>
being of familiar occurrence at this time. Thus in a
treaty agreed upon between the Mayor, sheriffs, and
commonalty of Norwich in 1414, it was declared that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>‘the mayor and twenty-four (of the council) shall
choose a common clerk, a coroner, two clavers, and
eight constables, and the sixty common council shall
choose a common speaker, one coroner, two clavers,
and eight constables.’ (‘Hist. Norf.,’ Blomefield.) In a
day when there were no patent safes we can readily
understand the importance of appointing men whose
one care it was to guard the chests wherein were
stored up the various parchments, moneys, and seals
belonging to the civic council. This comprises our
list of Norman civil officers. One name, and one only,
of this class is Saxon, that of ‘Alderman,’ but I have
found it occurring as a surname in only one or two
instances, and I believe it has now become obsolete.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turning from municipal to ecclesiastical affairs,
we find the Church of mediæval times surrounded
with memorials. Some of these I have already
hinted at as being mere sobriquets;<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c009'><sup>[170]</sup></a> none the less,
however, do we owe them to the existing institutions.
Such names as ‘Hugo le Archevesk’ or ‘William le
Arceveske’ can be only thus viewed. In ‘Morte
Arthure’ the hero holds festival at Caerleon,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wyth dukez, and dusperes of dyvers rewmes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Erles and erchevesques, and other ynowe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Byschopes and bachelers and banerettes nobille.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>While this has long vanished from our directories, the
descendants of ‘John le Bissup’ or ‘Robert le Biscop’
are firmly established therein. The more Norman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>‘Robert le Vecke’ and ‘Nicholas le Vesk’ still live
also in our ‘Vicks’ and ‘Vecks.’ It was only the
other day I saw ‘Archdeacon’ over a hatter’s shop—and
that it is no corruption of some other word,
we may cite the early ‘Thomas le Arcedekne’ as a
proof.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c009'><sup>[171]</sup></a> Whether ‘Archpriest,’ a sobriquet occurring
at the same date, was but another designation of the
same, or performed more episcopal functions, I
cannot say.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c009'><sup>[172]</sup></a> The name, however, is obsolete in every
sense. The old vicar has bequeathed us our ‘Vicars,’
‘Vicarys,’ and ‘Vickermans.’ Chaucer says in the
‘Persons Prologue’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sire preest, quod he, art thou a vicary?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or art thou a Person? say soth by thy fay.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Parsons,’ as Mr. Lowther thinks, are but a
form of ‘Piers’ son,’ that is, ‘Peters’ son.’ It is,
however, quite possible for them to be what they more
nearly resemble; indeed, I find the name occurring as
such in the case of ‘Walter le Persone,’ found in the
Parliamentary Rolls. Well would it be if we could
say of each village cure now what our great early
poet said of one he pictured forth—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A good man there was of religioun,</div>
      <div class='line'>That was a poure Persone of a town,</div>
      <div class='line'>But riche he was of holy thought and werk,</div>
      <div class='line'>He was also a lerned man, a clerk,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Our ‘Priests’ and ‘Priestmans’<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c009'><sup>[173]</sup></a> answer for themselves.
‘Thomas le Prestre’ and ‘Peter le Prest,’ I
do not doubt myself, were but other changes rung
upon the same, but I shall have occasion hereafter to
propose, at least, a different origin for the latter. The
lower ministerial office is suggested to us in ‘Philip
le Dekene’ and ‘Thomas le Deken,’ but we must be
careful not to confound them with ‘Deakin,’ which is
often but another form of ‘Dakin,’ that is, ‘Dawkin,’
or ‘little David.’<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c009'><sup>[174]</sup></a> Our ‘Chaplains’ or ‘Chaplins,’ once
written more fully as ‘Reginald le Chapeleine,’ represent
less one who officiated in any public sanctuary
than him who was attached to some private oratory
belonging to one of the higher nobility. Our ‘Chanters’
or ‘Canters’ (‘Xtiana le Chauntour,’ A., ‘William le
Chantour,’ M.) still maintain the dignity of the old
precentors who led the collegiate or cathedral choir—but
the once existing ‘Chanster’ (‘Stephen le Chanster,’
J.), strictly speaking the feminine of the other, is
now obsolete.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c009'><sup>[175]</sup></a> In our ‘Chancellors’ we may recognise
the ancient ‘John le Chanceler’ or ‘Geoffry le Chaunceler,’
he to whose care was committed the chapter,
books, scrolls, records, and what other literature belonged
to the establishment with which he stood connected.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>‘Clerk’ as connected with the Church has come
down in the world, for as ‘clericus,’ or ‘clergyman,’
it once belonged entirely to the ordained ministry.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c009'><sup>[176]</sup></a>
The introduction of lay-clerks, appointed to lead the
responses of the congregation, has, however, connected
them all but wholly with this later office. Nor have
our ‘Secretans,’ or ‘Sextons,’ or ‘Saxtons’ preserved
their early dignity. The sacristan was he who
had charge of the church-edifice, especially the robes
and vestments, and such things as appertained to the
actual service.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c009'><sup>[177]</sup></a> The present usually accepted meaning
of the term, that understood by our great
humorist poet when he said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He went and <i>told</i> the sexton,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the sexton <i>tolled</i> the bell,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>is quite of later growth. In our ‘Colets’ and
‘Collets’ (sometimes the diminutives of ‘Colin’)
we are reminded of the colet, or acolyte, who
waited upon the priest and assisted in carrying the
bread and wine, in lighting the candles, and performing
all subordinate duties. Our ‘Bennets,’ when
not belonging to the class of baptismal names (as a
corruption of ‘Benedict’), once performed the functions
of exorcists, and by the imposition of hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>and the aspersion of holy water expelled evil spirits
from those said to be thus possessed. Last of this
group we may mention our ‘Croziers’ and ‘Crosiers,’
they who at this time bore the pastoral staff. Mediæval
forms of these are met with in ‘Simon le
Croyzer’ or ‘Mabel la Croiser.’ I doubt not that he
was a kind of chaplain to his superior, whose official
staff it was his duty to bear. In the Book of Common
Prayer of the 2nd year of Edward VI. it is
directed: ‘Whensoever the bishop shall celebrate
the holy communion, or execute any other public
office, he shall have upon him, besides his rochet, an
alb and cope, or vestment, and also his pastoral staff
in his hand, or else borne by his chaplain.’</p>

<p class='c007'>When we turn our eyes for a moment to the old
monastic institutions, we see that they, too, are far
from being without their relics. In them we have
more distinctly the echo of a departed time. Many
of my readers will be familiar with the distinction
recorded in such names as ‘Alexander le Seculer’
and ‘Walter le Religieuse,’ or ‘man of religion,’ as
Chaucer would have termed the latter. To be
‘<i>religious</i>’ in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
was to be one of a monastic order bound by vows.
Thus our great mediæval poet says in his Romance—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Religious folk ben full covert,</div>
      <div class='line'>Secular folke ben more apert,</div>
      <div class='line'>But natheless, I will not blame</div>
      <div class='line'>Religious folke, ne them defame</div>
      <div class='line'>In what habite that ever they go;</div>
      <div class='line'>Religion humble, and true also,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will I not blame, ne despise.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The ‘religieuse’ has apparently stuck to his vows,
for I have never found the term in an hereditary form,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>while ‘Secular,’ as descended from such enrolled folk
as ‘Walter le Secular,’ or ‘Joan, uxor Nicholas le
Secular,’ still exists. I am afraid, however, the Secularist
of that time could and would have told us a
different tale. Of these bound orders too, while the
general term, as I say, does not now exist surnominally,
all the more particular titles which it embraced
do. As we catch the cadence of their names a
shadow falls athwart our memories, and in its wake a
crowd of dim and unsubstantial figures pass before
us. Once more we behold the fiery ‘Abbot’ (Juliana
Abbot, A., Ralph le Abbe, C.), and the portly ‘Prior’
or ‘Pryor’ (Roger le Priour, B., William le Priur, E.).
We see afresh the ‘Friar,’ or ‘Freere,’ or ‘Frere’
(Syward le Frere, A., Geoffrey le Frere, A.), so ‘pleasant
of absolution’ and ‘easy of penance.’ Again
our eye falls mistily upon the ‘Canon,’ or ‘Cannon’
(William le Cannon, A., Thomas le Canun, E.), with
his well-trimmed beard and capped brow, and the
‘Moyne’ (now ‘Munn’) or ‘Monk’ (Beatrix le Munk,
A., Thomas le Mun, A., Ivo le Moyne, A.), all closely
shaved and cloaked, and cowled, that knew his way to
the cellar better than to the chapel, who loved the song
more than the chaunt.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c009'><sup>[178]</sup></a> And now in quick succession
flit by us a train of personages all beshrouded in garbs
of multitudinous and quaint aspect, in cloaks and hoods,
and tippets and girdles, and white and dark apparel.
There is the wimpled, grey-eyed ‘Nunn’ (Alice la
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Nonne, A.), and the Dorturer, represented in olden
registers by such a name as ‘Robert le Dorturer,’ he
who looked to the arrangements of the dourtour, or
dormitory—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His death saw I by revelation,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sayde this frere, at home in our dortour.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c009'><sup>[179]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The word still existed in the sixteenth century, as is
evidenced by Heywood’s use of it. He says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The tongue is assigned of wordes to be sorter;</div>
      <div class='line'>The mouth is assigned to be the tongue’s <i>dorter</i>;</div>
      <div class='line'>The teeth are assigned to be the tongue’s porter;</div>
      <div class='line'>But wisdom is ’signed to tye the tongue shorter.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The figure is somewhat forced, but it has its beauty.
The ‘Fermerer,’ now found as ‘Fermor’ and ‘Firmer,’
was he who superintended the infirmary. Only a few
lines further on, in the earlier of the two poems from
which I last quoted, we find Chaucer making mention
of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>Our sexton, and our fermerere,</div>
      <div class='line'>That have been trewe freres fifty year.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The ‘Tale of a Monk,’ too, begins—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A black munk of an abbaye</div>
      <div class='line'>Was enfermer of alle I herd say—</div>
      <div class='line'>He was halden an hali man</div>
      <div class='line'>Imange his felaus.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The fermery was the hospital or ‘spital’<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c009'><sup>[180]</sup></a> attached to
each religious house, and was under the immediate
control of the above-mentioned officer. It is with him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>therefore, we may fitly ally ‘Robert le Almoner,’ or
‘Michael le Aumoner,’ a name still abiding with us,
and representative of him who dispensed the alms to
the lazars and the poor. It is in allusion to this his
office that Robert Brunne in one of his tales says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Seynt Jone, the aumenere,<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c009'><sup>[181]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>Saith Pers, was an okerere</div>
      <div class='line'>And was very coveytous</div>
      <div class='line'>And a niggard and avarus.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Of the same officer in more lordly society the ‘Boke
of Curtasye’ thus speaks—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Aumonere a rod schalle have in honde,</div>

      <div class='line'>Alle the broken mete he kepys in wait</div>
      <div class='line'>To dele to pore men at the gate.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Many of those who were supported at this time and
in this manner were lepers. We can take up no
record, large or small, of the period without coming
across a ‘Nicholas’ or ‘Walter le Leper.’ Leprosy
was introduced into Western Europe with the return
of the Crusaders. To such a degree had it spread in
England, that in 1346 Edward III. was compelled to
issue a royal mandate enjoining those ‘smitten with
the blemish of leprosy’ to ‘betake themselves to
places in the country, solitary, and notably distant’
from the dwellings of men. Such a distinctive designation
as this would readily cling to a man, even after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>he had been cured of the disorder,<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c009'><sup>[182]</sup></a> and no wonder
that in our ‘Lepers’ and ‘Leppers’ the name still
remains as but one more memorial of that noble madness
which set Christendom ablaze some six centuries
ago. A term used synonymously at this time with
leper is found in such an entry as ‘Richard le Masele’
or ‘Richard le Masle,’ that is, ‘Measle.’ Wicklyffe has
the word in the case of Naaman, and also of the Samaritan
leper.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c009'><sup>[183]</sup></a> Langland speaks of those who are
afflicted with various ailments, and adds that they, if
they</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take these myschiefs meeklike,</div>
      <div class='line'>As mesels, and others,</div>
      <div class='line'>Han as pleyn pardon</div>
      <div class='line'>As the plowman hymselve.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Capgrave, too, to quote but one more instance, speaking
of Deodatus, a Pope of the seventh century, says
‘He kissed a mysel and sodeynly the mysel was
whole.’ Strange to say, this name also is not extinct.
Our ‘Badmans’ are not so bad as they might seem.
They, and our ‘Bidmans,’ are doubtless but corrupted
forms of the old ‘bedeman,’ or ‘beadman,’ he who
professionally invoked Heaven in behalf of his patron.
It is hence we get our word ‘bead,’ our forefathers
having been accustomed to score off the number of
aves and paternosters they said by means of these
small balls strung on a thread. This practice, I need
not say, is still familiar to the Romish Church.</p>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>But we have not yet done with the traces of these
more distant practices. The various religious wanderers
or solitary recluses, though belonging to a
system long faded from our English life, find a perpetual
epitaph in the directories of to-day. Thus we
have still our ‘Pilgrims,’ or ‘Pelerins’ (‘John Pelegrim,’
A., ‘William le Pelerin,’ E.), as the Normans
termed them. We may meet with ‘Palmers’
(‘Hervey le Palmer,’ A., ‘John le Paumer,’ M.) any
day in the streets of our large towns, names distinctly
relating the manner in which their owners have
derived their title. The pilgrim may have but visited
the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury; the latter,
as his sobriquet proves, had, forlorn and weary, battled
against all difficulties, and trod the path that led to
the Holy Sepulchre—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The faded palm-branch in his hand</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The ‘Pardoner,’ with his pouch choked to the full
(‘Walter le Pardoner,’ M.) with saleable indulgences,
had but come from Rome. He was an itinerant retailer
of ecclesiastic forgivenesses, and was as much
a quack as those who still impose upon the credulity
of the bucolic mind by selling cheap medicines.
As Chaucer says of him—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With feigned flattering and japes,</div>
      <div class='line'>He made the parson and the peple his apes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Hermit’ I have failed to find as at present existing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>though ‘Hermitage’ or ‘Armitage’ (‘John Harmaytayge,’
W. 3), as local names expressive of his
abode, are by no means unfamiliar. Our ‘Anchors’
and ‘Ankers,’ however, still live to commemorate the
old ancre or anchorite; he who, as his sobriquet implied,
was wont to separate himself from the world’s
vain pleasures and dwell in seclusion and solitude.
In the ‘Romance of the Rose’ it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sometime I am religious,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now like an anker in an house.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Piers in his ‘Vision,’ too, speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ancres and heremites</div>
      <div class='line'>That holden them in their celles.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Hugh le Eremite’ or ‘Silvester le Hermite’ are early
forms of the one, while in the other case we find the
aspirate added in ‘John le Haneker.’ The modern
dress of this latter, however, presents the usual early
and more correct spelling.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c009'><sup>[185]</sup></a> What a vision is presented
for our notice in these various sobriquets. It
is the vision of a day that has faded, a day with many
gleams of redeeming light, but a day of ignorance and
lethargy; a day which, after all, thank God, was but
the precursor of the brighter day of the Reformation,
when the Church, true to herself and true to her
destiny, threw off the shackles and the fetters that
bound her, and began a work which her greatest foes
have been compelled to admit she carried through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>amid opposition of the deadliest and most crushing
kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before passing on to a survey of our feudal aristocracy,
I may mention our ‘Latimers,’ or ‘le Latymer,’
as I find it recorded in early lists. A latinier, or
latimer, was literally a speaker or writer of Latin, that
language being then the vehicle of all record or transcript.
Latin, indeed, for centuries was the common
ground on which all European ecclesiastics met.
Thus it became looked upon as the language of interpretation.
The term I am speaking of, however,
seems to have become general at an early stage. An
old lyric says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lyare was mi latymer,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sloth and sleep mi bedyner.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Sir John Maundeville, describing an eastern route,
says (I am quoting Mr. Lower)—‘And men alleweys
fynden Latyneres to go with them in the contrees
and furthere beyonde in to tyme that men conne the
language.’ Teachers of the Latin tongue itself were
not wanting. ‘Le Scholemayster’ existed so early
as the twelfth century to show that there were those
who professed to initiate our English youth in the
rudiments of that which was a polite and liberal education
in the eyes of that period. Such sobriquets
as ‘le Gramayre,’ or ‘Gramary,’ or ‘Grammer,’ represented
the same avocation, being nothing more than
the old Norman ‘Gramaire,’ or ‘Grammarian’ as we
should now call him, only we now apply the term to
a philologist rather than a professional teacher. As
‘Grammar’ the surname is far from being obsolete in
our midst. A ‘Nicholas le Lessoner’ is met with in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the Hundred Rolls. He was evidently but a schoolmaster
also. The verb ‘to lesson,’ <i>i.e.</i> to teach, is
still in use in various parts of the country, and we
find even Shakespeare using it. Clarence says to his
murderer—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Bid Gloster think of this, and he will weep;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>to which the murderer replies—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ay, millstones; as he lessoned us to weep.</div>
      <div class='c021'>(<i>Richard III.</i>, act. i. sc. iii.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>In looking over the pages of our early Anglo-Norman
history we are at once struck by the fact of
the absence of any middle class; that important
branch of our community which in after and more
civilised ages has done so much for English liberty
and English strength. The whole genius of the
feudal constitution was opposed to this. There was
indeed a graduating scale of feudal tenure which
bound together and connected each community; but
there was of equal surety in the chain of these independent
links of society a certain ring where all
alliance ceased save that of service, and which
separated each provincial society into two widely-sundered
classes. On the one side were the baron
and his nearer feudatories and retainers; and below
this, on the other, came under one common standard
the villein, the peasant, and the boor, looked upon by
their superiors with contemptuous indifference, and
barely endured as necessary to the administration of
their luxury and pleasure. We have already mentioned
many of those who gave the baron support. Of other
his vassals we may cite ‘le Vavasour,’ or ‘Valvasor,’
a kind of middle-class landowner. The lower orders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>of chivalry have left us in our many ‘Knights’<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c009'><sup>[186]</sup></a> and
‘Bachelors’ or ‘Backlers’ a plentiful token of former
importance. Our ‘Squiers,’ ‘Squires,’ ‘Swiers,’ or
‘Swires’<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c009'><sup>[187]</sup></a> carry us, as does the now meaningless
Esquire, to the time when the sons of those ‘Knights’
bore, as the name implies, their shields. By the time
of Henry VI., however, it had become adopted by the
heirs of the higher gentry, and now it is used indiscriminately
enough. Those who are so surnamed
may comfort themselves at any rate with the reflection
that they are lineally descended from those who bore
the name when it was an honourable and distinctive
title. ‘Armiger,’ the form in which the word was
oftentimes recorded in our Latin rolls, still survives,
though barely, in our ‘Armingers,’ this corrupted form
being in perfect harmony with all similar instances,
as we shall see almost immediately. One of our
mediæval rhymes speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ten thousand knights stout and fers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Withouten hobelers and squyers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>These hobelers are far from being uninteresting.
When we talk of riding a hobby, we little think what
a history is concealed beneath the term. A hobiler<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c009'><sup>[188]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>in the days we are speaking of, was one who held by
tenure of maintaining a hobbie—a kind of small horse,
then familiarly so known. A song on the times,
written in the fourteenth century, and complaining of
the manner in which the upper classes plundered the
poor, says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And those hoblurs, namelich,</div>
      <div class='line'>That husband benimeth eri of ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>Men ne should them bury in none chirch,</div>
      <div class='line'>But cast them out as a hound.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Later on, by its fictitious representation in the Morris
dances of the May-day sports, the hobby came to
denote the mere dummy, and now as such affords
much scope for equestrian skill in the Rotten Row of
our nurseries. What tricks time plays with these
words, to be sure, and what a connexion for our
‘Hoblers’ and ‘Hobblers’ to meditate upon. Our
‘Bannermans’ are Scotch, but they represent an office,
whether in England or the North, whose importance
it would be hard to estimate at this period. Nor are
we without traces in our nomenclature of its existence
in more southern districts. Our not unfamiliar ‘Pennigers’
and ‘Pennigars’ are but the former official
<i>pennager</i>, he who bore the ensign or standard of his
lord. They figure even in more general and festive
pageants. In the York Procession we find walking
alone and between the different craftsmen the ‘Pennagers.’
Probably they bore the ensigns of that then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>important corporate city. I have but recently referred
to ‘Robert Clavynger’ (H.) and the probability
of his having carried the club or mace or key of his
superiors in office. All or well-nigh all the above
names find themselves well represented in the registers
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Our eye
falls at once on an ‘Andrew le Gramary,’ a ‘Richard
le Gramayre,’ a ‘Thomas le Skolmayster,’ a ‘Warin le
Latimer,’ a ‘William le Latiner,’ a ‘Jordan le Vavasur,’
a ‘Simon le Knyt,’ a ‘Gilbert le Bacholer,’ a ‘Walter
le Squier,’ or a ‘Nicholas Armiger.’</p>
<p class='c007'>A curious relic of the military tactics of mediæval
times is presented to our notice in our ‘Reuters,’
‘Ritters,’ and ‘Rutters.’ The old English forms are
found in such entries as ‘Thomas le Reuter,’ or
‘Ranulph le Ruter.’ The root of the term is probably
the German ritter, or rider, a name given at
this period to certain mercenary soldiers oftentimes
hired by our English sovereigns out of Brabant and
the surrounding country. Thus we find William of
Newburgh, under the date 1173, saying that Henry II.
‘stipendarias Bribantionum copias, quas Rutas vocant,
accersivit.’ (Lib. ii. cap. 27.) Trivet, relating the
same fact, says (p. 73), ‘Conduxit Brabanzones et
Rutarios.’<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c009'><sup>[189]</sup></a> An old song begins—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Rutterkyn is come into owre towne,</div>
      <div class='line'>In a cloke withoute cote or gowne,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save a raggid hood to kover his crowne</div>
      <div class='line in15'>Like a rutter hoyda.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Rutterkyn can speke no Englyssh,</div>
      <div class='line'>His tonge runneth all on buttyrd fyssh,</div>
      <div class='line'>Besmeared with grece abowte his disshe,</div>
      <div class='line in18'>Like a rutter hoyda.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The nickname ‘rutterkin’ proves the Flemish origin
of these troopers. Their capacity for stowing away
food and drink, from all accounts, is not exaggerated
in the poem from which the above is an extract. We
have just mentioned our ‘Bachelors,’ and this reminds
us of our ‘Childs,’ and of the days of chivalry. The
term ‘child’ was a distinctly honourable title in the
olden times. It was borne by the sons of all the
higher nobility; if by the eldest son, then in right of
his title to his father’s honours and possessions; if
more generally by others, then until by some deed of
prowess they had been raised to the ranks of knighthood.
In either case ‘child’ was the term in use
during this probationary state. Thus Byron in his
‘Childe Harold’ has but revived the ‘Childe Waters,’
‘Childe Rolands,’ and ‘Childe Thopas’s’ of earlier
times.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c009'><sup>[190]</sup></a> We owe many existing and several obsolete
surnames to this custom. Our ‘Childs’ are but descendants
of such a sobriquet as ‘Ralph le Child;’
our ‘Eyres’ of such an entry as ‘William le Eyre;’
some of our ‘Barnes’ may be but the offspring of such
a personage as ‘Thomas le Barne’ (now ‘bairn,’ that
is, the born one); while ‘Stephen le Enfant’ or
‘Walter le Enfaunt’ represents an appellation that is
now obsolete in England.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c009'><sup>[191]</sup></a> I need scarcely add that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>this last, in the form of Infante and Infanta, still
bears the same meaning in the royal families of Spain
that Child did in our own land in more chivalric
days.</p>

<p class='c007'>The details of early feudal life are wonderfully
depicted by our nomenclature. Owing to the boundless
and forced ceremony which arose out of the prevailing
spirit of feudal pride, our official memorials are
well-nigh overwhelming. Feudal tenure itself became
associated with office, and none seemed too servile for
acceptance. As has been said of Charlemagne’s
Court, so might it be said of those of others—‘they
were crowded with officers of every rank, some of the
most eminent of whom exercised functions about the
royal person which would have been thought fit only
for slaves in the palace of Augustus or Antonine’—‘to
carry his banner or his lance, to lead his array, to
be his marshall, or constable, or sewer, or carver, to
do in fact such services, trivial or otherwise, as his
lord might have done himself, in proper person, had
it so pleased him—this was the position coveted by
youths of birth and distinction at such a period as
this.’ Many of these officerships, or the bare titles,
still linger round the court of our sovereign. The
higher feudatories, of course, followed the example
thus set them by their suzerain, and the lesser barons
these, and thus household officers sprang up on every
side. See how this has left its mark upon our surnames.
‘John le Conestable,’ or ‘Robert le Constable,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>I need not say, is still well represented. In the ‘Man
of Lawes Tale’ the poet says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The constable of the castel doun is fare</div>
      <div class='line'>To see this wreck.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>With him we may ally our not unfamiliar ‘Castlemans,’
‘Castelans,’ and ‘Chatelains,’ representatives
of the old ‘John le Chastilioun,’ or ‘Joscelin le Castelan,’
or ‘Ralph le Chatelaine.’ The poet whom I
have just quoted says elsewhere:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now am I king, now chastelaine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Doubtless this latter was but a synonym of the constable,
and his duties as governor but the same. Of
decidedly lower position, but not dissimilar in character,
we have also ‘Wybert le Portere,’ or ‘Portarius,’
as he is Latinized in our rolls. An old book of
etiquette says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When thou comes to a lordis gate</div>
      <div class='line'>The porter thou shalle fynde therate.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>He at the postern would as carefully look against
hostile, as our former ‘Peter le Ussher,’ or ‘Alan le
Usser,’ within would against informal approach.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c009'><sup>[192]</sup></a> The
Saxon form, however, was evidently not wanting, for
we have still ‘Doorward’ and ‘Doorman’ (‘Geoffrey
le Doreward,’ A., ‘Nicholas le Doreman,’ O.) in our
directories, not to mention their corrupted, ‘Durwards,’
immortalized by Walter Scott, and ‘Dormans’
and ‘Domans.’ The term ‘doorward’ is found in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>many of our early writers. Thus in an old metrical
account of the bringing of Christ before Caiaphas, it
is said of John when he returned to fetch in Peter:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He bid the dureward</div>
      <div class='line'>Let in his fere.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Our ‘Chamberlaynes’ and ‘Chambers,’<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c009'><sup>[193]</sup></a> (‘Simon
le Chamberlain,’ M., ‘Henry le Chaumberleyne,’ B.,
‘William de la Chaumbre,’ B.) had access to their lord’s
inner privacy, and from their intimacy with his monetary
affairs occupied a position at times similar to that
of our more collegiate bursar. We have only to look
at mediæval costume, its grandeur, its colours, and its
varied array, to understand how necessary there should
be a special officer to superintend his lord’s wardrobe.
Our ‘Wardrops’ are but the former ‘de la Wardrobe,’
or ‘de la Garderoba,’ while ‘le Wardrober,’ or ‘le
Garderober,’ has bequeathed us our ‘Wardropers.’
Thus the ‘Book of Curtasye’ says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The usshere shalle bydde the wardropere</div>
      <div class='line'>Make redy for alle, night before they fere.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Equally important as an attendant was the ‘Barbour.’
He especially was on familiar terms with his master—when
was he not? I need scarcely say that among
his other duties that of acting as surgeon in the household
was none of the lightest. Still his tonsorial
capacity was his first one. No one then thought of
shaving himself, least of all the baron. Even so late
as the sixteenth century a writer defending the use
of the beard against Andrew Boorde employs this
argument:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>But, syre, I praye you, if you tell can,</div>
      <div class='line'>Declare to me, when God made man</div>
      <div class='line'>(I meane by our forefather Adam),</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether that he had a berde then;</div>
      <div class='line'>And if he had, who did hym shave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since that a barber he could not have.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I have no doubt it is here we must set our ‘Simisters,’
relics, as they probably are, of such a name as ‘John
Somayster,’ or ‘William Summister.’ The summaster
seems from its orthography to have represented one
who acted as a clerk or comptroller, something akin
to the chamberlain or breviter, whom I shall mention
almost immediately; one, in fact, who cast up and
certified accounts. Holinshed used the word as if in
his day it were of familiar import. Dwelling upon a
certain event, he says—‘Over this, if the historian be
long, he is accompted a trifler; if he be short, he is
taken for a summister.’<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c009'><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In such days as those, what with the number of
personal retainers and the excess of hospitality expected
of the feudal chief, the culinary department
occupied far from an insignificant position in regard
to the general accessories of the baronial establishment.
Our ‘Cooks,’ or ‘Cokes,’ or ‘Cookmans,’
relics of the old ‘Roger le Coke,’ or ‘Joan le Cook,’
or ‘William Cokeman,’ even then ruled supreme
over that most absolute of all monarchies, the kitchen;
our ‘Kitchenmans’ (now found also as ‘Kitchingham’),
‘Kitcheners,’ and ‘Kitchens,’ or ‘de la Kitchens,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>as they were once written, reminding us who it
was that aided them to turn the spit or handle
the posnet. Our ‘Pottingers’ represent the once
common ‘Robert le Potager,’ or ‘Walter le Potager,’
the soup-maker. <i>Potage</i> was the ordinary term for
soup, thickened well with vegetables and meat.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c009'><sup>[195]</sup></a>
Thus in the ‘Boke of Curtasye’ the guest is bid—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Suppe not with grete sowndynge,</div>
      <div class='line'>Neither potage ne other thynge—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>a rule which still holds good in society. We are
well aware of the ingredients of the dish which
our Bible translators have still bequeathed to us
as ‘a mess of potage.’ In its present corrupted
form of ‘porridge’ this notion of a <i>mess</i> rather than
of a <i>soup</i> is still preserved. Another interesting
servitorship of this class has well-nigh escaped our
notice—that of the hastiler: he who turned the <i>haste</i>
or spit. In the Close Rolls we find a ‘Thurstan le
Hastler’ recorded, and in the Parliamentary Writs
such names as ‘Henry Hastiler’ and ‘William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Hastiler.’ In the will of Humphrey de Bohun, Earl
of Essex, among other household servants, such as
potager, ferour, barber, ewer, is mentioned ‘William
de Barton, hastiler.’ I need not remind Lancashire
people that a <i>haister</i>, or <i>haster</i>, is still the term used
for the tin screen employed for roasting purposes.
The memorials of this interesting servitorship still
linger on in our ‘Hastlers,’ ‘Haslers,’ and ‘Haselers.’
If, however, the supervision of the roasting and basting
required an attendant, none the less was it so
with the washing-up department. How familiarly
does such a term as ‘scullery’ fall from our lips, and
how little do many of us know of its history. An
<i>escuelle</i><a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c009'><sup>[196]</sup></a> was a porringer or dish, and a <i>scullery</i> was a
place where such vessels were stored after being
washed.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c009'><sup>[197]</sup></a> Hence a ‘squiller’ or ‘squyler’ was he
who looked to this; our modern ‘scullion,’ in fact,
which is but a corrupted form of the same word. In
one of Robert of Brunne’s poems, we find him
saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And the squyler of the kechyn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Piers, that hath woned (dwelt) here yn.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c009'><sup>[198]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>In a book of ‘Ordinances and Regulations’ we
find mention made even of a ‘sergeant-squylloure.’
Doubtless his duty was to look after the carriage of
utensils at such times as his lord made any extended
journey, or to superintend the washing of cup and
platter after the open-board festivities which were the
custom of early baronial establishments. To provide
for every retainer who chanced to come in would be,
indeed, a care. The occurrence of a ‘Roger de
Norhamtone, Squyler,’ however, in the London City
rolls, seems to imply that occasionally the sale of such
vessels gave the title. I cannot say the name is
obsolete, as I have met with one ‘Squiller;’ and
‘Skiller,’ which would seem to be a natural corruption,
is not uncommon. Our ‘Spencers,’ abbreviated
from ‘despencer,’ had an important charge—that of
the ‘buttery,’ or ‘spence,’ the place where the
household store was kept. The term is still in use, I
believe, in our country farm-houses. In the ‘Sumner’s
Tale’ the glutton is well described as—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>All vinolent as botel in the spence;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and Mr. Halliwell, I see, with his wonted research,
has lighted on the following lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yet I had lever she and I</div>
      <div class='line'>Were both togyther secretly</div>
      <div class='line'>In some corner in the spence.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c009'><sup>[199]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘De la Spence,’ as well as ‘le Spencer,’ has impressed
itself upon our living nomenclature. Our ‘Panters,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>‘Pantlers,’ and ferocious-seeming ‘Panthers,’ descendants
of such folk as ‘Richard le Panter,’ or ‘Robert
le Paneter,’ or ‘Henry de le Paneterie,’ are but relics
of a similar office. They had the superintendence
of the ‘paneterie,’ or pantry; literally, of course,
the bread closet. It seems, however, early to have
become used in a wider and more general sense.
In the Household Ordinances of Edward IV. one
of the sergeants is styled ‘the chief Pantrer of the
King’s mouth.’ John Russel in his ‘Boke of Nurture’
thus directs his student—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The furst yere, my son, thou shalt be pantere or buttilare,</div>

      <div class='line'>The third, sharp and kene, to smothe the trenchers and square.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c009'><sup>[200]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Of the old ‘Achatour’ (found as ‘Henry le Catour’
or ‘Bernard le Acatour’), the purveyor for the
establishment, we have many memorials, those of
‘Cater,’ ‘Cator,’ and ‘Caterer’ being the commonest.
Chaucer quaintly remarks of the ‘Manciple,’<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c009'><sup>[201]</sup></a> who
was so</p>

<p class='c017'>The provisions thus purchased were called ‘cates,’ a
favourite word with some of our later poets.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Equivalent to the more monastic ‘le Cellarer,’<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c009'><sup>[202]</sup></a> which
is now obsolete, are our numberless ‘Butlers,’ the
most accepted form of the endless ‘Teobald le Botilers,’
‘Richer le Botillers,’ ‘Ralph le Botelers,’
‘William le Botellers,’ ‘Walter le Butillers,’ or ‘Hugh
le Buteilliers,’ of this time. As we shall observe
by-and-by, however, this was also an occupative name.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c009'><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>With so many officers to look after the preparations,
we should expect the dinner itself to be somewhat
ceremonious. And so it was—far more ceremonious,
however, than elegant in the light of the
nineteenth century. Our ‘Senechals’ and ‘Senecals’
(‘Alexander le Seneschal,’ B., ‘Ivo Seneschallus,’
T.), relics of the ancient ‘seneschal,’ Latinized in
our records as ‘Dapifer’ (‘Henry Dapifer,’ A.), arranged
the table. The root of this word is the Saxon
‘schalk,’ a servant which, though now wholly obsolete,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>seems to have been in familiar use in early
times.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c009'><sup>[204]</sup></a> An old poem tells us—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then the schalkes sharply shift their horses,</div>
      <div class='line'>To show them seemly in their sheen weeds.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In ‘Sir Gawayne,’ too, the attendant is thus described—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>Clene spurs under</div>
      <div class='line'>Of bright golde, upon silk bordes, barred full rich,</div>
      <div class='line'>And scholes (depending) under shanks, there the schalk rides.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We are not without traces of its existence in other
compounds. Thus our ‘Marshalls’ were originally
‘marechals;’ that is, ‘mare-schalks,’ the early name
for a horse-groom or blacksmith. The Marshall,
however, was early turned into an indoor office, and
seems to have been busied enough in ordering the
position of guests in the hall, a very punctilious affair
in those days. The ‘Boke of Curtasye’ says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In halle marshalle alle men schalle sett,</div>
      <div class='line'>After their degre, withouten lett.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Gateschales,’ a name now altogether obsolete,
were the more simple porter, while our ‘Gottschalks,’
a surname more frequently hailing from Germany, but
once common with ourselves as a Christian name,
denote simply ‘God’s servant.’ But we are wandering.
Let us come back to the dinner-table. Such
sobriquets as ‘Ralph le Suur’<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c009'><sup>[205]</sup></a> or ‘John le Sewer’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>remind us of the <i>sewer</i>—he who brought in the
viands.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c009'><sup>[206]</sup></a> A <i>sewe</i>, from the old French sevre, to follow,
was any cooked dish, and thus is simply equivalent to
our <i>course</i>. Chaucer, in describing the rich feasts of
Cambuscan, King of Tartary, says the time would
fail him to tell—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Of their strange sewes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I believe the Queen’s household still boasts its four
gentlemen sewers. As a surname, too, the word is
still common. A curious custom presents itself to
our remembrance in our ‘Says,’ who, when not of the
‘de Says’ (‘Hugh de Say,’ A.), are but descendants
of the ‘le Says’ (‘John le Say,’ M.) of the Hundred
Rolls. An ‘assay’ or ‘say’ was he who assayed or
tasted the messes as they were set one by one before
the baron, to guard against his being accidentally
or purposely poisoned. An old poem uses the fuller
form, where it says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thine assayer schalle be an hownde,</div>
      <div class='line'>To assaye thy mete before thee.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the ‘Boke of Curtasye,’ too, we are told to what
ranks this privilege belonged—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No mete for man schalle sayed be,</div>
      <div class='line'>But for kynge, or prynce, or duke so fre.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c009'><sup>[207]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Another term for the same made its mark upon
our nomenclature as ‘Gustur’ (‘Robert le Gustur,’
T.) To <i>gust</i> was thus used till Shakespeare’s day,
and we still speak of ‘<i>gusto</i>’ as equivalent to <i>relish</i>.</p>
<p class='c007'>We are reminded by the fact of the existence of
‘Knifesmith’ and ‘Spooner’ only among our early
occupative surnames that there were no forks in those
days.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c009'><sup>[208]</sup></a> There is no ‘Forker’ to be found. Even the
‘Carver’ (‘Adam le Kerver,’ A., ‘Richard le Karver,’
A.) had to use his fingers. In the ‘Boke of
Kervynge,’ a manual of the then strictest etiquette in
such matters, we find the following direction:—‘Set
never on fyshe, flesche, beest, ne fowle, more than two
fyngers and a thombe.’ Seldom, too, did they use
plates as we now understand them. Before each
guest was set a round slice of bread called a trencher,
and the meat being placed upon this, he consumed
the whole, or as much as he pleased. Under these
circumstances we can easily understand how necessary
would be the office of ‘Ewer,’ a name found in
every early roll as ‘Brian le Ewer,’ or ‘Richard le
Ewere,’ or ‘Adam de la Euerie.’ As he supplied water
for each to cleanse his hands he was close followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>by the ‘napper’ or ‘napier,’ who proffered the towel
or napkin. The word, I need scarcely say, is but a
diminutive of the old <i>nape</i>, which was applied in
general to the tablecloths and other linen used in
setting forth the dinner. An old book, which I have
already quoted, in directing the attendant how to lay
the cloth, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The over nape schall double be layde.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The Hundred Rolls and other records furnish us with
such names as ‘Jordan le Nappere,’ or ‘John le Napere,’
or ‘Walter de la Naperye.’ Behind the lord of
the board, nigh to his elbow, stood the ‘page,’ holding
his cup. This seems to have been an office much
sought after by the sons of the lower nobility, and it
is to the honourable place in which it was held we no
doubt owe the fact that not merely are our ‘Pages’
decidedly numerous in the present day, but that we
also find such further particular compounds as
‘Small-page,’<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c009'><sup>[209]</sup></a> ‘Little-page,’ or ‘Cup-page’ holding
anything but a precarious existence in our midst.
There seems to have been but little difference between
this office and that of the ‘henchman,’ only that the
latter, as his name, more strictly written ‘haunchman,’
shows, attended his master’s behests out of doors.
He, too, lives on hale and hearty in our ‘Henchmans,’
‘Hinxmans,’ ‘Hincksmans,’ and ‘Hensmans.’<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c009'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>In several of our early records of names we find
‘Peter le Folle,’ ‘Alexander le Fol,’ and ‘Johannes
Stultus’ appearing in apparently honest and decent
company. The old fool or jester was an important
entity in the retinue of the mediæval noble. He
could at least say, if he might not do, what he liked,
and I am afraid the more ribald his buffoonery the
greater claim he possessed to be an adept in his profession
in the eyes of those who heard him. His
dress was always in character with his duties, being
as uncouth as fashion reversed could make it. In his
hand he bore a mock rod of state, his head was surmounted
by a huge cap peaked at the summit and
surrounded with little jingling bells, his dress was in
colour as conflicting as possible, and the <i>tout ensemble</i>
I need not dwell upon. We still talk of a ‘foolscap,’
and even our paper has preserved the term from the
fact that one of the earliest watermarks we have was
that of a fool’s cap with bells. ‘Fools,’ I need not
say, wherever else to be met with, are now obsolete
so far as our directories are concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have just mentioned the henchman. This at
once carries us without the baronial walls, and in
whatever scene we are wont to regard the early suzeraine
as engaging, it is remarkable how fully marked
is our nomenclature with its surroundings. Several
useful servitorships, however, claim our first attention.
In such days as these, when the telegraph wire was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>an undreamt-of mystery, and highways traversed by
steam-engines would have been looked upon as something
supernatural indeed, we can readily understand
the importance of the official ‘Roger le Messager,’
or ‘John le Messager,’ nor need we be surprised by
the frequency with which he is met. In the ‘Man
of Lawes Tale’ it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This messager to don his avantage</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the Kinges mother rideth swift.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Though generally found as ‘Messinger’ or ‘Massinger,’
the truer and more ancient form is not wholly
obsolete.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c009'><sup>[211]</sup></a> But if there were no telegraphs, neither
was there any regular system of postage. The name
of ‘Ely le Breviter’ or ‘Peter le Brevitour’ seems to
remind us of this. I do not doubt myself the ‘breviter’
was kept by his lord for the writing or conveyance
of letters or brevets.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c009'><sup>[212]</sup></a> Piers Plowman uses the
word where, of the Pardoner’s preaching, it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lewed men loved it wel,</div>

      <div class='line'>And blered their eighen.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c009'><sup>[213]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>The signet of his lord was in the hands of the
‘Spigurnell’ or ‘Spigurell,’ both of which forms still
exist, I believe, in our general nomenclature. As the
sealer of all the royal writs, the king’s spigurell would
have an office at once important and careful. The
term itself is Saxon, its root implying that which is
shut up or sealed. Our ‘Coffers,’ relics of the old
‘Ralph le Cofferer,’ or ‘John le Cofferer,’ though
something occupative, were nevertheless official also,
and are to be found as such in the thirteenth century.
They remind us of the day when there were no such
things as cheque-books, nor banks, nor a paper-money
currency. Then on every expedition, be it warlike
or peaceful, solid gold or silver had to be borne
for the baron’s expenditure and that of his retinue;
therefore none would be more important than he who
superintended the transit from place to place of the
chest of solid coinage set under his immediate care.
Our early ‘Passavants,’ or ‘Pursevaunts,’ or more
literally pursuivants, were under the direction of the
‘Herald,’or ‘Heraud,’ as Chaucer styles him, and
usually preceded the royal or baronial retinue to announce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>its approach, and attend to such other duties
of lesser importance as his superior delegated to him.
In this respect he occupied a position much akin to
that of the ‘Harbinger’ or ‘Herberger,’ who prepared
the <i>harborage</i> or lodging, and all other entertainment
required ere the cavalcade arrived. When we reflect
upon the large number of retainers, the ceremonious
list of attendants, the greater impediments to early
travel, and the difficulties of forwarding information,
we shall see that these officerships were by no means
so formal as we might be apt to imagine. To give
illustrations of all the above-mentioned surnames
were easy, were it not that the number is so large
that it becomes a difficulty which to select. Such
entries, however, as ‘Jacob le Messager,’ ‘Godfrey le
Coffrer,’ ‘Roger Passavant,’ ‘Main le Heralt,’ ‘Herbert
le Herberjur,’ ‘Nicholas le Spigurnell,’ ‘Peter le
Folle,’ or the Latinized ‘Johannes Stultus,’ may be
recorded as among the more familiar. A reference
to the Index will furnish examples of the rest, as well
as additional ones of the above.</p>
<p class='c007'>In a day when horses were of more consequence
than now, we need not be surprised to find the
baronial manger under special supervision. This
officer figures in our mediæval archives in such entries
as ‘Walter le Avenur’ or ‘William le Avenare.’<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c009'><sup>[214]</sup></a> As
his very name suggests, it was the avenar’s care to
provide for the regular and sufficient feeding of the
animals placed under his charge.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c009'><sup>[215]</sup></a> The ‘Boke of
Curtayse’ tells us his duties—</p>

<p class='c017'>Elsewhere, too, the same writer says—</p>

      <div class='line'>A maystur of horsys a squyer ther is,</div>
      <div class='line'>Aveyner and ferour under him i-wys.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Palfreymans’ (‘John le Palfreyman,’ M.), though
not always official, I do not doubt had duties also
of a similar character in looking after the well-being
of their mistress’s palfrey, and attending the lady
herself when she rode to the cover, or took an airing
on the more open and breezy hillside.</p>
<p class='c007'>The two great amusements of the period we are
considering were the hunt and the tournament. Of
the former we have many relics, nor is the latter
barren or unfruitful of terms connected therewith that
still linger on in the surnames of to-day. The exciting
encounters which took place in these chivalric
meetings or jousts had a charm alike for the Saxon
and the Norman; alike, too, for spectator as well as
for him who engaged in the fierce mêlée. Training
for this was by no means left to the discretion of
amateur intelligence. In three several records of the
thirteenth century I find such names as ‘Peter le
Eskurmesur,’ ‘Henry le Eskyrmessur,’ and ‘Roger le
Skirmisour.’ The root of these terms is, of course,
the old French verb ‘eskirmir,’ to fence. It is thence
we get our <i>skirmish</i> and <i>scrimmage</i>, the latter form,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>though looked upon now as of a somewhat slang
character, being found in the best of society in our
earlier writers. Originally it denoted a hand-to-hand
encounter between two horsemen. We still imply by
a skirmish a short and sharp conflict between the advanced
posts of two contending armies. As a teacher
of ‘the noble art of self-defence,’<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c009'><sup>[216]</sup></a> we can easily
understand how important was the skirmisher. The
name has become much corrupted by lapse of time,
scarcely recognisable, in fact, in such a garb as
‘Scrimmenger,’ ‘Skrymsher,’ ‘Skrimshire,’ and perchance
‘Scrimshaw,’ forms which I find in our
present London and provincial directories. Of those
who were wont to engage we have already mentioned
the majority. All the different grades of
nobility were present, and with them were their
esquires, with shield and buckler, ready to supply a
fresh unsplintered lance, or a new shield, with its
proudly emblazoned crest. I need scarce remind the
reader of what consequence in such a day as this
would be the costume of him who thus engaged in
such deadly conflict. The invention of gunpowder
has changed the early tactics of fight. Battles are
lost and won now long ere the real mêlée has taken
place. Then everything, whether in war or tournament,
was settled face to face. To pierce his
opponent where an inlet could admit his spear, or to
unhorse him by the shock of meeting, was the knight’s
one aim. The bloodiness of such an affray can be
better imagined than described. We still hear of
distorted features in the after inspection of the scene
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>of battle, but we can have no conception of the mangling
that the bodies of horse and rider underwent,
the inevitable result of the earlier manner of warfare.
Death is mercifully quick now upon the battle-field.
We have still three or four professional surnames that
remind us of this. We have still our ‘Jackmans,’ or
‘Jakemans,’ as representatives of the former cavalry;
so called from the ‘jack’ or coat of mail they wore.
It is this latter article which has bequeathed to our
youngsters of the nineteenth century their more
peaceful and diminutive <i>jacket</i>. Thus mailed and
horsed, they had to encounter the cruel onslaught of
our ‘Spearmans,’ and ‘Pikemans,’ and ‘Billmans,’
names that themselves suggest how bloody would be
the strife when hatchet blade, and sharp pike, and
keen sword clashed together. To cover and shield
the body, then, was the one thought of these early
days of military tactics, and at the same time to give
the fullest play to every limb and sinew. This was a
work of a most careful nature, and no wonder it demanded
the combined skill of several craftsmen.
Such occupative sobriquets as ‘Adam le Armerer’
or ‘Simon le Armurer’ are now represented by
the curter ‘Armer’ or ‘Armour.’ In the ‘Knight’s
Tale’ it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There were also of Martes division</div>
      <div class='line'>Th’ armerer, and the bowyer, and the smith,</div>
      <div class='line'>That forgeth sharpe swerdes on his stith.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Frobishers,’ ‘Furbishers,’ and ‘Furbers,’ once
found as ‘Richard le Fourbishour’ or ‘Alan le
Fourbour,’ scoured and prepared the habergeon, or
jack just referred to, while ‘Gilbert le Hauberger’ or
‘John le Haubergeour’ was more immediately engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>in constructing it. Our present Authorized
Version, I need hardly say, still retains the word. In
‘Sire Thopas,’ too, it is used where it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And next his schert an aketoun,</div>
      <div class='line'>And over that an habergoun.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our classical-looking ‘Homers’ are the naturally
corrupted form of the once familiar ‘le Heaumer,’ he
who fashioned the warrior’s helmet.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c009'><sup>[217]</sup></a> Our ‘Sworders,’
I imagine, forged him his trusty blade,<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c009'><sup>[218]</sup></a> while our
‘Sheathers’ furnished forth its slip. Our ‘Platers’
I would suggest as makers of his cuirass, while our
‘Kissers’—far less demonstrative than they look—are
but relics of such a name as ‘Richard le Kissere,’
he who manufactured his <i>cuishes</i> or thigh armour,
one of the most careful parts of the entire dress.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c009'><sup>[219]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Lastly, our ‘Spurriers’ were there ready to supply
him with his rowel, and thus in warlike guise he was
prepared either for adventurous combat in behalf of
the distressed damsel, or to seek favour in the eyes of
her he loved in the more deadly lists.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c009'><sup>[220]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I must not forget to mention our ‘Kemps’ while
upon military affairs, a general term as it was for a
soldier in the days of which we are speaking. I
believe the phrase ‘to go a kemping’ is still in use
in the north. In the old rhyme of ‘Guy and Colbrand’
the minstrel says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

<p class='c017'>How familiar a term it must have been in the common
mouth the frequency with which the name is met
fully shows.</p>
<p class='c007'>Our ‘Slingers’ represent an all but forgotten profession,
but they seem to have been useful enough in
their day and generation. The sling was always
attached to a stick, whence the old term ‘staffsling.’

<p class='c017'>But we must not forget old England’s one boast, her
archers, and our last quotation fitly brings them to
our notice. They, too, in the battle-field and in the
rural list, maintained alike their supremacy. If we
would be proud of our early victories, we must ever
look with veneration on the bow. ‘Bowman’ and
‘Archer’ still represent the more military professional,
but not alone. Even more interesting, as
speaking for the more specific crossbow or ‘arbalist,’
are our ‘Alabasters,’ ‘Arblasters,’ ‘Arblasts,’ and
‘Balsters.’ In Robert of Gloucester’s description of
the reign of the Conqueror, it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So great power of this land and of France he nom (took)</div>
      <div class='line'>With him into England, of knights and squires,</div>
      <div class='line'>Spearmen anote, and bowemen, and also arblasters.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Chaucer, too, describing a battlement, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And eke within the castle were</div>
      <div class='line'>Springoldes, gonnes, bowes, and archers,</div>
      <div class='line'>And eke about at corners</div>
      <div class='line'>Men seine over the wall stand</div>
      <div class='line'>Grete engines, who were nere hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in the kernels, here and there,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of arblasters great plentie were.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the Hundred Rolls he is Latinized as ‘John Alblastarius,’
and in the York Records as ‘Thomas Balistarius.’
The Inquisitiones style him ‘Richard le
Alblaster,’ while the Parliamentary Writs register
him as ‘Reginald le Arblaster.’ It was to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>class of armour our word ‘artillery’ was first applied,
a fact which our Bible translators have preserved,
where, in describing the meeting between
David and Jonathan, they speak of the latter as
giving his ‘artillery to the lad.’ Cotgrave, too, in
his dictionary, printed at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, has the following:—‘Artellier, a
bowyer or bow-maker, also a fletcher, or one that
makes both bows and arrows.’ The mention of the
fletcher brings us to the more general weapon. Such
an entry as the following would seem strange to the
eyes of the nineteenth century:—‘To Nicolas Frost,
bowman, Stephen Sedar, fletcher,<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c009'><sup>[221]</sup></a> Ralph, the stringer,
and divers others of the said mysteries, in money,
paid to them, viz.:—to the aforesaid Nicholas, for 500
bows, 31<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i>; to the aforesaid Stephen, for 1,700
sheaves of arrows, 148<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i>; and to the aforesaid
Ralph, for forty gross of bowstrings, 12<i>l.</i>’ (Exchequer
Issues, 14 Henry IV.) This short extract in
itself shows us the origin of at least three distinct
surnames, viz.:—‘Bowyer,’ ‘Fletcher,’ and ‘Stringer.’
We should hardly recognise the first, however, in such
entries as ‘Adam le Boghiere,’ or ‘William le Boghyere.’
‘John le Bower’ reminds us that some of
our ‘Bowers’ are similarly sprung, while ‘George le
Boyer’ answers for our ‘Boyers.’ Besides these, we
have ‘Robert Bowmaker’ or ‘John Bowmaykere’
to represent the fuller sobriquet. So much for the
bow. Next comes the arrow. This was a very careful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>piece of workmanship. Four distinct classes of
artizans were engaged in its structure, and, as we
might expect, all are familiar names of to-day.
‘John le Arowsmyth’ we may set first. He confined
himself to the manufacture of the arrow-head. Thus
we find the following statement made in an Act passed
in 1405:—‘Item, because the Arrowsmyths do make
many faulty heads for arrows and quarels, it is
ordained and established that all heads for arrows
and quarels, after this time to be made, shall be well
boiled or braised, and hardened at the points with
steel.’ (Stat. Realm.)<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c009'><sup>[222]</sup></a> ‘Clement le Settere’ or
‘Alexander le Settere’<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c009'><sup>[223]</sup></a> was busied in affixing these
to the shaft, and ‘John le Tippere’ or ‘William le
Tippere’ in pointing them off. Nor is this all—there
is yet the feather. Of the origin of such mediæval
folk as ‘Robert le Fleccher’ or ‘Ada le Fletcher,’
we are reminded by Milton, where, in describing an
angel, he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>His locks behind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Illustrious on his shoulders, <i>fledge</i> with wings,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lay waving round.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The fletcher, or fledger as I had well-nigh called him,
spent his time, in fact, in feathering arrows.</p>
<p class='c007'>Skelton in ‘The Maner of the World’ says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>So proude and so gaye,</div>
      <div class='line'>So riche in arraye,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so skant of mon-ey</div>
      <div class='line in12'>Saw I never:</div>
      <div class='line'>So many bowyers,</div>
      <div class='line'>So many fletchers,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so few good archers</div>
      <div class='line in12'>Saw I never.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>While all these names, however, speak for specific
workmanship, our ‘Flowers’ represent a more general
term. We are told of Phœbus in the ‘Manciples
Tale,’ that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His bowe he bent, and set therein a flo.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Flo,’ was a once familiar term for an arrow. ‘John
le Floer,’ or ‘Nicholas le Flouer,’ therefore, would
seem to be but synonymous with ‘Arrowsmith’ or
‘Fletcher.’ ‘Stringer’ and ‘Stringfellow’ are self-explanatory,
and are common surnames still. What
a list of sobriquets is here! What a change in English
social life do they declare. Time was when to be
a sure marksman was the object of every English
boy’s ambition. The bow was his chosen companion.
Evening saw him on the village green, beneath the
shade of the old yew tree, and as he practised his
accustomed sport, his breath would come thick and
fast, as he bethought him of the coming wake, and
his chance of bringing down the popinjay, and presenting
the ribbon to his chosen queen of the May.
Yes, times are altered. Teeming cities cover the once
rustic sward, broadcloth has eclipsed the Lincoln
green, the clothyard, the arrow; but still amid the
crowd that rushes to and fro in our streets the name
of an ‘Archer,’ or a ‘Bowman,’ or a ‘Butts,’ or a
‘Popgay’ spoken in our ears will hush the hubbub of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>the city, and, forgotten for a brief moment the greed
for money, will carry us, like a pleasant dream recalled,
into the fresher and purer atmosphere of England’s
past.</p>
<p class='c007'>In the poem from which I have but recently
quoted we have the record of ‘gonnes,’ or ‘guns,’ as
we should now term them. It would be quite possible
for our nomenclature to be represented by
memorials of the powder magazine, and I should be
far from asserting that such is not the case.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c009'><sup>[224]</sup></a> In the
household of Edward III. there are enumerated,
among others, ‘Ingyners lvij; Artellers vj; Gonners
vj.’ Here there is a clear distinction between the
‘gun’ and the ‘engine;’ between missiles hurled by
powder and those by the catapult. Fifty years even
earlier than this Chaucer had used the following sentence:—‘They
dradde no assaut of gynne, gonne,
nor skaffaut.’ In his ‘Romance,’ too, as I have just
shown, he places in juxtaposition ‘grete engines’ and
‘gonnes.’ Of one, if not both of these, we have undoubted
memorials in our nomenclature. The Hundred
Rolls furnish us with a ‘William le Engynur’ and
a ‘Walter le Ginnur;’ the Inquisitiones with a ‘Richard
le Enginer,’ and the Writs with a ‘William le Genour.’
The descendants of such as these are, of course, our
‘Gunners,’ ‘Ginners,’ ‘Jenour,’ and ‘Jenners,’<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c009'><sup>[225]</sup></a> the
last of which are now represented by one who is as
renowned for recovering as his ancestor in days gone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>by would be for destroying life. Our ‘Gunns’ and
‘Ginns’ also must be referred to the same source. In
one of the records just alluded to a ‘Warin Engaine’
is to be met with. If we elide the first syllable, as in
the previous instances, the modern form at once
appears.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if in the deadly tournament the baron and
his retainers found an ample pastime, nevertheless the
chase was of all diversions the most popular. In this
the prince and the peasant alike found recreation,
while with regard to the latter, as we shall see, it was
also combined with service. The woody wastelands,
so extended in these earlier days of a sparse population,
afforded sport enough for the most ardent huntsman.
According to the extent of privilege or the
divisions into which they were separated, these tracts
were styled by the various terms of ‘forest,’ ‘chase,’
‘park,’ and ‘warren.’ To any one at all conversant
with old English law these several words will be
familiar enough. To keep the wilder beasts within
their prescribed limits, to prevent them injuring the
tilled lands, and in general to guard the common
interests of lord and tenant, keepers were appointed.
The names of these officers, the chief of whom are
entitled by appellations whose root is of a local
character, are well-nigh all found to this day in our
directories. Indeed there is no class of names more
firmly imbedded there. In the order of division I
have just alluded to, we have ‘Forester,’ with its
corrupted ‘Forster’ and ‘Foster,’ relics of such
registered folk as ‘Ivo le Forester,’ ‘Henry le Forster,’
or ‘Walter le Foster;’ ‘Chaser,’ now obsolete, I believe,
but lingering on for a considerable period as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>offspring of ‘William’ or ‘Simon le Chasur;’
‘Parker,’ or ‘Parkman,’ or ‘Park,’ descended from
‘Adam le Parkere,’ or ‘Hamo le Parkere,’ or ‘Roger
atte Parke,’ or ‘John del Parc,’ and ‘Warener’ or
‘Warner,’ or ‘Warren,’ lineally sprung from men of
the stamp of ‘Thomas le Warrener,’ ‘Jacke le Warner,’
or ‘Richard de Waren.’ The curtailed forms of these
several terms seem to have been all but consequent
with the rise of the officership itself. ‘Love’ in the
‘Romance’ says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now am I knight, now chastelaine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now prelate, and now chaplaine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now priest, now clerke, now forstere.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In his description of the Yoman, too, Chaucer adds—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>An horne he bere, the baudrick was of grene,</div>
      <div class='line'>A fostere was he sothely as I guesse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus, again, Langland, in setting forth Glutton’s encounter
with the frequenters of the tavern, speaks
familiarly of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Watte the Warner.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>But these are not all. It is with them we must associate
our ancestral ‘Woodwards’ or ‘Woodards,’ and
still more common ‘Woodreefs,’ ‘Woodrows,’ ‘Woodroffs,’
and ‘Woodruffs,’ all more or less perverted
forms of the original wood-reeve.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c009'><sup>[226]</sup></a> A song representing
the husbandmen as complaining of the burdens in
Edward II.’s reign says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The hayward heteth us harm to habben of his</div>
      <div class='line'>The bailif beckneth us bale, and weneth wel do;</div>
      <div class='line'>The wodeward waiteth us wo.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>All these officers were more or less of legal capacity,
men whose duty it was, bill in hand, to guard the vert
and venison under their charge,<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c009'><sup>[227]</sup></a> to act as agents for
their lord in regard to the pannage of hogs, to look
carefully to the lawing of dogs, and in case of offences
to present them to the verderer at the forest assize.
The ‘Moorward,’ found in our early records as
‘German le Morward’ or ‘Henry le Morward,’
guarded the wilder and bleaker districts. ‘The Rider,’
commonly found as ‘Roger le Rydere’ or ‘Ralph le
Ryder,’ in virtue of having a larger extent of jurisdiction,
was mounted, though his office was essentially
the same. Mr. Lower, remarking upon this word, has
a quotation from the ballad of ‘William of Cloudesley,’
where the king, rewarding the brave archer, says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I give thee eightene pence a day,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And my bowe thou shalt bere,</div>
      <div class='line'>And over all the north countrè</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I make thee chyfe rydere.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>With him we must associate our ‘Rangers’ and
‘Keepers,’ who, acting doubtless under him, assisted
also in the work of patrolling the woodland and recovering
strayed beasts, and presenting trespassers to
the swainmote just referred to.</p>
<p class='c007'>The bailiff, shortened as a surname into ‘Bailey,’
‘Baillie’ (‘German le Bailif,’ J., ‘Henry le Baillie,’
M.), like the reve, seems to have been both of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>legal and private capacity; in either case acting as
deputy.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c009'><sup>[228]</sup></a> This word ‘reve’ did a large amount of
duty formerly, but seems now to be fast getting into
its dotage. In composition, however, it is far from
being obsolete. The ‘Reeve’ (‘John le Reve,’ M.,
‘Sager le Reve,’ H.), who figured so conspicuously
among the Canterbury Pilgrims, would be the best
representative of the term in his day, I imagine—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His lordes shepe, his nete, and his deirie,</div>
      <div class='line'>His swine, his hors, his store, and his pultrie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were wholly in this reves governing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Grieves’ (‘Thomas le Greyve,’ A.), who are but
the fuller ‘Gerefa,’ fulfilled, and I believe in some parts
of Scotland still fulfil, the capacity here described,
being but manorial bailiffs, in fact. ‘The Boke of
Curtasye’ says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Grayvis, and baylys, and parker</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall come to accountes every yere</div>
      <div class='line'>Byfore the auditours of the lorde.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus, too, our ‘Portreeves’ (‘William le Portreve,’ A.,
‘Augustin le Portreve,’ A.), who in our coast towns
fulfilled the capacity of our more general mayor, are
oftentimes in our earlier records enrolled as Portgreve.’
‘Hythereve’ (‘John le Huthereve,’ O.), from
hithe, a haven, would seem to denote the same
office, while our obsolete ‘Fenreves’ (‘Adam le
Fenreve,’ A.), like the ‘Moorward’ mentioned above,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>had charge, I doubt not, of the wilder and more
sparsely populated tracts of land. Many other compounds
of this word we have already recorded; some
we shall refer to by-and-by, and with them and these
the reeve, after all, is not likely to be soon forgotten.</p>
<p class='c007'>But the poorer villeins were not without those
who should guard their interests also. In a day of
fewer landmarks and scantier barriers trespasses
would be inevitable. An interesting relic of primitive
precaution against the straying of animals is found in
the officership of the ‘Hayward’ (or ‘Adam le Heyward,’
as the Hundred Rolls have it), whose duty it
was to guard the cattle that grazed on the village
common. He was so styled from the Saxon ‘hay’
or ‘hedge,’ already spoken of in our previous chapter.
An old poem has it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In tyme of hervest mery it is ynough;</div>
      <div class='line'>Peres and apples hongeth on bough,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hayward bloweth mery his horne;</div>
      <div class='line'>In every felde ripe is corne.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In ‘Piers Plowman,’ too, we have the word—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I have an horne, and be a hayward,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And liggen out a nyghtes</div>
      <div class='line'>And kepe my corne and my croft</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From pykers and theves.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It will be seen from these two references that the
officership was of a somewhat general character. The
cattle might be his chief care, but the common village
interests were also under his supervision. The term
has left many surnames to maintain its now decayed
and primitive character; ‘Hayward’ and ‘Haward’
are, however, the most familiar. ‘Hayman,’ doubtless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>is of similar origin. If, in spite of the hayward’s
care, it came to pass that any trespass occurred, the
village ‘pounder’ was ready at hand to impound the
animal till its owner claimed it, and paid the customary
fine—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In Wakefield there lives a jolly pinder,</div>
      <div class='line'>In Wakefield, all on a green.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>So we are told in ‘Robin Hood.’ I need not add
that our many ‘Pounders,’ ‘Pinders,’ and still more
classic ‘Pindars,’ are but the descendants of him or
one of his <i>confrères</i>. I do not doubt myself, too, that
our ‘Penders’ (‘William le Pendere’ in the Parliamentary
Writs) will be found to be of a similar origin.</p>
<p class='c007'>While, however, these especial officers superintended
the general interests of lord and tenant, there
were those also whose peculiar function it was to
guard the particular quarry his master loved to chase;
to see them unmolested and undisturbed during such
time as the hunt itself was in abeyance, and then,
when the chase came on, to overlook and conduct its
course. These, too, are not without descendants.
Such names as ‘Stagman’ and ‘Buckmaster,’<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c009'><sup>[229]</sup></a> ‘Hindman’
and ‘Hartman,’ ‘Deerman’ and its more amatory
‘Dearman,’ by their comparative frequency,
remind us how important would be their office in the
eye of their lord.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor are those who assisted in the lordly hunt
itself left unrepresented in our nomenclature. The
old ‘Elyas le Hunderd,’ or ‘hund-herd,’ has left in our
‘Hunnards’ an abiding memorial of the ‘houndsman.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Similarly the ‘vaultrier’ was he who unleashed them.
It has been a matter of doubt whether or no the more
modern ‘feuterer’ owes his origin to this term, but
the gradations found in such registrations as ‘John
le Veutrer,’ ‘Geoffrey le Veuterer,’ and ‘Walter le
Feuterer,’ to be met with in the rolls of this period,
set all question, I should imagine, at rest. An old
poem, describing the various duties of these officers
and their charges, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A halpeny the hunte takes on the day</div>
      <div class='line'>For every hounde the sothe to say;</div>
      <div class='line'>The vewtrer, two cast of brede he tase,</div>
      <div class='line'>Two lesshe of greyhounds if that he has.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Fewter’ and ‘Futter,’<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c009'><sup>[230]</sup></a> however, seem to be the only
relics we now possess of this once important care.
Such names as ‘John le Berner’ or ‘Thomas le
Berner,’ common enough in old rolls, must be distinguished
from our more aristocratic ‘Berners.’ The
<i>berner</i> was a special houndsman who stood with fresh
relays of dogs ready to unleash them if the chase
grew heated and long. In the Parliamentary Rolls
he is termed a ‘yeoman-berner.’ Our ‘Hornblows,’
curtailed from ‘Hornblower,’ and simpler ‘Blowers,’
would seem to be closely related to the last, for the
horn figured as no mean addition by its jubilant
sounds to the excitement of the chase. He who used
it held an office that required all the attention he
could bring to bear upon it. The dogs were not unleashed
until he had sounded the blast, and if at any
time from his elevated station he caught sight of the
quarry, he was by the manner of winding his instrument
to certify to the huntsman the peculiar class to
which it belonged. In the Hundred Rolls we find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>him inscribed as ‘Blowhorn,’ a mere reversal of syllables.
Of a more general and professional character
probably would be our ‘Hunters,’ ‘Huntsmans,’ and
‘Hunts,’ not to mention the more Norman ‘John le
Venner’ or ‘Richard Fenner.’ It may not be known
to all our ‘Hunts’ that theirs, the shorter form, was
the most familiar term in use at that time; hence the
number that at present exist. We are told in the
‘Knight’s Tale’ of the—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hunte and horne, and houndes him beside;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>while but a little further on he speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The hunte ystrangled with the wilde beres.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Forms like ‘Walter le Hunte’ or ‘Nicholas le Hunte’
are very common to the old records. As another
proof of the general use of this word we may cite
its compounds. ‘Borehunte’ carries us back to the
day when the wild boar ranged the forest’s deeper
gloom. ‘Wolfhunt,’ represented in the Inquisitiones
by such a sobriquet as ‘Walter le Wolfhunte,’
reminds us that Edgar did not utterly exterminate
that savage beast of prey, as is oftentimes asserted.
A family of this name held lands in the Peak of
Derbyshire at this period by the service of keeping the
forest clear of wolves. In the forty-third year of
Edward III. one Thomas Engeine held lands in
Pitchley, in the county of Northampton, by service of
finding at his own cost certain dogs for the destruction
of wolves, foxes, &amp;c., in the counties of Northampton,
Rutland, Oxford, Essex, and Buckingham; nay, as
late as the eleventh year of Henry VI. Sir Robert
Plumpton held one borate of land in Nottinghamshire,
by service of winding a horn, and chasing or frightening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the wolves in Sherwood Forest.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c009'><sup>[231]</sup></a> Doubtless, however,
as in these recorded instances, it would be in the
more hilly and bleaker districts, or in the deeper
forests, he found his safest and last retreat. It seems
well-nigh literally to be coming down from a mountain
to a mole-hill to speak of our ‘Mole-hunts,’ the
other compound of this word. But small as he was
in comparison with the other, he was scarcely less obnoxious
on account of his burrowing propensities, for
which the husbandman gave him the longer name of
mouldwarp. His numbers, too, made him formidable,
and it is no wonder that people found occupation
enough in his destruction, or that the name of ‘Molehunt’
should have found its way into our early rolls.
So late, indeed, as 1641, we find in a farming book
the statement that 12<i>d.</i> was the usual price paid by
the farmer for every dozen old moles secured, and 6<i>d.</i>
for the same number of young ones. This speaks
at least for their plentifulness. An old provincialism
for mole, and one not yet extinct, was ‘wont’ or
‘want.’ This explains the name of ‘Henry le
Wantur,’ which may be met with in the Hundred
Rolls. In the Sloane MS. is a method given ‘for to
take wontes.’ It would be in the deeper underwood
our ‘Todmans’ and ‘Todhunters,’ the chasers of the
fox, or ‘tod,’ as he was popularly called, found diversion
enough. It would be here our ‘Brockmans’
secured the badger. I doubt not these were both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>also of professional character—aids and helps to the
farmer. Indeed, he had many upon whose services
he could rely for a trifle of reward in the shape of a
silver penny, or a warm mess of potage on the kitchen
settle. Our ‘Burders’ and ‘Fowlers,’ by their craft,
whether of falconry or netting, or in the use of the
cross-bow bolt, aided to clear the air of the more
savage birds of prey, or of the lesser ones that would
molest the bursting seed. I need scarcely remark
that the distinction between ‘bird’ and ‘fowl’ is
modern. The ‘fowls of the air’ with our Saxon
Bible, and up to very recent days, embraced every
winged creature, large and small. In our very expression
‘barndoor-fowl’ we are only using a phrase which
served to mark the distinction between the wilder and
the more domesticated bird. The training and sale
of bullfinches seem to have given special employment
then, as now, to such as would undertake the care
thereof. A ‘Robert le Fincher’ occurs at an early
period, and I see his descendants are yet in being.
As we shall see in a later chapter, this bird has set
his mark deeply upon our sobriquet nomenclature.
Our ‘Trappers,’ whether for bird or beast, confined
their operations to the soil, capturing their spoil by
net or gin.</p>

<p class='c007'>We owe several names, or rather several forms of
the same name, to the once favourite pursuit of falconry.
Of all sports in the open air this was the one
most entirely aristocratic. In it the lord and his lady
alike found pleasure. It had become popular so early
as the ninth century, and, as Mr. Lower says, in such
estimation was the office of State falconer held in
Norman times that Domesday shows us, apart from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>others, four different tenants-in-chief, who are described
each as ‘accipitrarius,’ or falconer. Until John’s
reign it was not lawful for any but those of the highest
rank to keep hawks, but in the ‘Forest Charter’
a special clause was introduced which gave power to
every free man to have an aerie. So valuable was a
good falcon that it even stood chief among royal gifts,
and up to the beginning of the seventeenth century it
brought as much as 100 marks in the market.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c009'><sup>[232]</sup></a> Royal
edicts were even passed for the preservation of their
eggs. From all this, and much more that might be
adduced, it is easy to understand how important was
the office of falconer, nor need we wonder that it is
one of the most familiar names to be found in early
rolls. Of many forms those of ‘Falconer,’ ‘Falconar,’
‘Faulkner,’ ‘Falkner,’<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c009'><sup>[233]</sup></a> ‘Faulconer,’ and ‘Faukener,’
seem to be the commonest. The last form is found
in the ‘Boke of Curtasye’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>For their wardrop and wages also.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>In our former ‘Idonea or Walter le Oyseler’ we
recognise but another French term for the same. A
special keeper of the goshawk, or ‘oster,’ got into
mediæval records in the shape of ‘William le Astrier,’
or ‘Robert le Ostricer,’ or ‘Richard le Hostriciere,’
or ‘Godfrey Ostriciarius.’ The Latin ‘accipiter’
is believed to be the root of the term, which
with such other perverted forms as ‘Ostregier,’
‘Ostringer,’ ‘Astringer,’ and ‘Austringer,’ lingered on
the common tongue till so late as the seventeenth
century.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c009'><sup>[234]</sup></a> A curious proof of the prevailing passion is
found in the name of ‘Robert le Jessmaker,’ set down
in the Hundred Rolls. The ‘jess’ was the leathern
or silken strap fastened closely round the foot of the
hawk, from which the line depended and was held by
the falconer. That the demand for these should be
so great as to cause a man to give himself up entirely
to their manufacture, will be the best evidence of the
ardour with which our forefathers entered into this
pastime. The end of falconry was, however, sudden
as it was complete. The introduction of the musket
at one fell swoop did away with office, pursuit, with,
in fact, the whole paraphernalia of the amusement,
and now it is without a relic, save in so far as these
names abide with us.</p>

<p class='c007'>In concluding this part of our subject it is pleasant
to remind ourselves that, however strong might be the
antagonism which this chapter displays between Norman
and Saxon, the pride of the one, the oppression
of the other, that antagonism is now overpast and
gone. We well know that a revolution was at work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>sometimes showing itself violently, but generally
silent in its progress, by which happier circumstances
arrived, happier at any rate for the country at large.
We well know how this consummation came, how
these several races became afterwards one by the suppression
of that power the more independent of these
barons had wielded, by confusion of blood, by the
acquisition of more general liberty, by mutuality of
interests, by the contagious influences of commerce,
and, above all, by the kindly and prejudice-weakening
force of lapsing time. All this we know, and, as it is
in a sense foreign to our present purpose, I pass over
it now. I trust that I have already shown that there
is something, after all, in a name; at any rate in a
surname, for that in it is supplied a link between the
past and the present, for that in the utterance of one
of these may be recalled not merely the lineaments of
some face of to-day, but the dimmer outline of an age
which is past beyond recall for ever. Viewed in a
light so broad as this, the country churchyard, with
each mossy stone, is, apart from the diviner lessons it
teaches, a living page of history; and even the parish
register, instead of being a mere record of dry and
uninteresting facts, becomes instinct with the lives and
surroundings of our English forefathers.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SURNAMES OF OCCUPATION (COUNTRY).</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>I now come to the consideration of occupations
generally, and to this I think it will be advisable
to devote two chapters. One reason for so doing, the
main one in fact, is that they seem naturally to divide
themselves into two classes—those of a rural character,
very numerous at that time on account of agricultural
pursuits being so general, and those of a more diverse
and I may say civilized kind, bearing upon the community’s
life—literature and art, dress, with all its
varied paraphernalia, the boudoir and the kitchen.
In considering the former, the character of our surnames
will give us, I imagine, by no means a bad or
ineffective picture of the simplicity of our early rural
life, its retirement, and even calm. In shadowing
forth the latter, we shall be enabled to see what were
the available means of that age, and by the very
absence of certain names to realise how numberless
have been the resources that discovery has added at a
more recent period. It will be well, too, to give two
entire chapters to these surnames, as being worthy of
somewhat further particularity than the others. They
betray much more of our English life that has become
obsolete. Local names, as I have said already, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>they must ever denote much of change, denote the
changes more especially of Nature herself, which are
slow in general, and require more than the test of four
or five centuries to make their transitions apparent.
Personal or Christian names vary almost less than
these. The Western European system is set upon the
same foundation, and whatever has been peculiar to
separate countries has long since, by the intermingling
of nations, whether peaceful or revolutionary,
been added to the one common stock. Some indeed
have fallen into disuse through crises of various kinds.
A certain number, too, of a fanciful kind, as we have
already seen, have been added within the last two
centuries, but these latter have not of course affected
our surnames. Nicknames, which form so large a
proportion of our nomenclature, remain much the
same; for a nation’s tongue, while receiving a constant
deposit and throwing off ever a redundant phraseology,
still, as a rule, does not touch these; they are
taken from the deeper channel of a people’s speech.
But the fashion and custom of living is ever changing.
New wants spring up, and old requirements become
unneeded; fresh resources come to hand, and the
more antique are at once despised and thrown aside.
In a word, invention and discovery cast their shafts at
the very heart of usage. Thus it is that we shall have
such a large number of obsolete occupations to recount—occupations
which but for our rolls even the oldest
and most reliable of our less formal writings would
have failed to preserve to us.</p>
<p class='c007'>It is quite possible for the eye to light upon hamlets
in the more retired nooks and crannies of England
that have undergone but little change during even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>last six centuries, hamlets of which we could say with
Goldsmith:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How often have I paused on every charm,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sheltered cot, the cultivated farm,</div>
      <div class='line'>The never-failing brook, the busy mill,</div>
      <div class='line'>The decent church that topped the neighbouring hill,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>For talking age and whispering lovers made.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I have seen, or I at least imagined I have seen, such
a picture as this; but if there be, this of all times is
that in which we must be prepared for a revolution.
Our railways are every day but connecting us with
the more inaccessible districts, following as they do
the curves of our valleys, winding alongside our
streams, like nature and art in parallel. As they
thus increase they bear with them equally increased
facilities for carrying the modernized surroundings
and accessories of life on this, on that, and on every
hand. Thus usage is everywhere fast giving way
before utility, and thus in proportion as art and invention
get elbow-room, so does the primitive poetry
of our existence fade from view. We can remember
villages—there are still such—around which time had
flung a halo of so simple aspect, villages whose steads
were grouped with so exquisite a quaintness, so
utterly and beautifully irregular, so full of unexpected
joints and curves, and all so thatched, and embrowned,
and trellised, that with the loss of them we have lost
a pastoral. There may be indeed a certain poetry in
model villas of undeviating line and exact altitude;
there may be a beauty in an erection which reminds
you in perpetuity of the great Euclidian truth that a
straight line is that which lies evenly between its extreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>points, but at times it puts one in sober mood
to think all the touches of a past time are to fade
away, and these be in their stead. How different the
tale nomenclature tells us of former rusticity and
simpler tastes.</p>
<p class='c007'>The early husbandman required but little decorative
refinement for his homestead. To keep out
the cold blast and the driving rain, to have a niche by
the fireside comfortable and warm, this was all he
asked or wished for. His roof was all but invariably
composed of thack or thatch, and every village had its
‘thatcher.’ Busy indeed would he be as the late autumn
drew nigh, and stack and stead must be shielded from
the keen and chilling winter. The Hundred Roll forms
of the surname are ‘Joan le Thaccher’ and ‘Thomas
le Thechare;’ the Parliamentary Writs ‘John le
Thacher;’ while the more modern directory furnishes us
with such changes rung upon the same as ‘Thatcher,’
‘Thacker’<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c009'><sup>[235]</sup></a> (still a common provincialism for the occupation),
and ‘Thackery,’ or ‘Thackeray,’ or Thackwray.’<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c009'><sup>[236]</sup></a>
These latter are of course but akin to the old
‘John le Fermery,’ or ‘Richard le Vicary,’ the termination
added being the result of popular whim or caprice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Our ‘Readers’ had less to do with book lore than we
might have supposed, being but descendants of the
mediæval ‘William le Redere,’<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c009'><sup>[237]</sup></a> another term for the
same kind of labour. The old ‘Hellier,’ or ‘Helier,’
carries us back to a once well-known root. To ‘hill,’ or
‘hele,’ was to cover, and a ‘hilyer’ was a roofer.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c009'><sup>[238]</sup></a> Sir
John Maundville says with regard to the Tartars, ‘the
helynge of their houses, and ... the dores ben
alle of woode;’ and John of Trevisa speaks of the
English ‘whyt cley and red’ as useful ‘for to make
crokkes and other vessels, and barned tyyl to <i>hele</i>
with houses and churches.’ Gower, too, uses the word
prettily, but perfectly naturally, when he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She took up turves (turfs) of the lond,</div>
      <div class='line'>Withouten help of mannes hond,</div>
      <div class='line'>All heled with the grene grass.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c009'><sup>[239]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Amongst other of the many forms that still survive
surnominally we have ‘Hillyer,’ ‘Hillier,’ ‘Hellier,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>‘Hellyer,’ and the somewhat unpleasant ‘Helman’
and ‘Hellman.’ Earlier instances may be found in
the Hundred Rolls in such entries as ‘Robert le
Heliere’ or ‘Will. Heleman.’ Our ‘Tylers’ are well
and quaintly represented in the early rolls. One
mediæval spelling of this good old-fashioned name is
‘Tyghelere’ (Adam le Tyghelere, P.W.), while such
forms as ‘le Tuglur,’ ‘le Tuler,’ or ‘le Tewler,’ as
representatives of the Norman-French vocabulary,
meet us on every hand. Whether any of their descendants
have had the courage to reproduce any of
these renderings I cannot say. I do not find any in
our directories. Our ‘Smiths’ have not been quite
so qualmish. With the tylers we may fitly introduce
our ‘Shinglers,’ they who used the stout oaken wood
in the place of burnt clay. Churches were oftentimes
so covered. Mr. Halliwell quotes the following somewhat
sarcastic couplet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Flouren cakes beth the schingles alle</div>
      <div class='line'>Of cherche, cloister, boure, and halle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Piers Plowman, too, speaks similarly of Noah’s Ark
as the ‘shyngled ship.’<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c009'><sup>[240]</sup></a> All these names have, occupatively
speaking, now become obsolete, or nearly so;
our ‘Slaters,’ or ‘Sclaters,’ or ‘Slatters,’ having usurped
the entire position they were formerly content to share
with their humbler brethren.<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c009'><sup>[241]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>In the majority of the above names we shall find
the Saxon to be in all but whole possession of the
field. The fact is, the roof and its appurtenances
were little regarded for a long period by our early
architects, if we may give such a grand term to those
who set up the ordinary homestead of the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries. There were no chimneys
even in the residences of the rich and noble. A hole
in the roof, or the window, or the door, one of these,
whether in the homes of the peer or the peasant, was
the outlet for all obnoxious vapours. With the Normans,
however, came a great increase of refinement in
the masonry and wooden framework of which our
houses are composed. Such names as ‘Adam le
Quarreur,’ or ‘Hugh le Quareur,’ ‘Walter le Marbiler,’
or ‘Geoffrey le Merberer,’ ‘Gotte le Mazoun,’ or
‘Walter le Masun,’ or ‘Osbert le Machun’ represent
a cultivation of which the earlier settled race, if they
knew something, did not avail themselves in their
merely domestic architecture. Two of these occupations
are referred to by ‘Cocke Lorelle,’ when he
speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Masones, male-makers, and merbelers.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c009'><sup>[242]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Henry le Wallere,’ whose sobriquet was ennobled
later on by one of our poets, is the only entry I can
set by these as belonging to the Saxon tongue.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c009'><sup>[243]</sup></a> It
is the same with the Norman ‘Amice le Charpenter’
and ‘Alan le Joygnour.’ While the former framed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>the more solid essentials, the very name of the latter
infers a careful supervision of minutiæ, of which only
a more refined taste would take cognizance. The
descendants of such settlers as these still hold the
place they then obtained, and are unchanged otherwise
than in the fashion of spelling their name.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the plaster work we have a goodly array of
memorials, the majority of which, of course, are connected
with a higher class work than the mere cottager
required. The ordinary term in use at present
for a maker of lime is ‘limeburner.’ It is quite possible
that in our ‘Limebears’ or ‘Limebeers’ we have
but a corruption of this. Such sobriquets as ‘Hugh
le Limwryte’ and ‘John le Limer’ give us, however,
the more general mediæval forms. The latter is still
to be met with among our surnames. But these are
not all. We have in our ‘Dawbers’ the descendants
of the old ‘Thomas le Daubour,’ or ‘Roger le Daubere,’
of the thirteenth century. ‘Cocke Lorelle,’ whom I have
but just quoted, mentions among other workmen—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tylers, bryckeleyers, hardehewers;</div>
      <div class='line'>Parys-plasterers, daubers, and lymeborners.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Authorised Version’ when it speaks of ‘the wall
daubed with untempered mortar,’ still preserves their
memorial, and our ‘Plasters’ and ‘Plaisters’ are but
sturdy scions of many an early registered ‘Adam le
Plastier,’ ‘Joanna le Plaisterer,’ or ‘John le Cementarius.’
The last of this class I would mention is
‘Robert Pargeter’ or ‘William Pergiter,’ a name
inherited by our ‘Pargiters’ and ‘Pargeters.’ This
was an artisan of a higher order. He laboured, in
fact, at the more ornamental plaster work. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>accounts of Sir John Howard, <span class='small'>A.D.</span> 1467, is the following
entry:—‘Item, the vj day of Aprylle my master
made a covenaunt with Saunsam the tylere, that he
schalle pergete, and whighte and bemefelle all the new
byldynge, and he schalle have for his labore xiijs.
ivd.’<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c009'><sup>[244]</sup></a> It is used metaphorically, but I cannot add
very happily, in an old translation of Ovid—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thus having where they stood in vaine complained of their wo,</div>
      <div class='line'>When night drew neare they bad adue, and eche gave kisses sweete</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the parget on their side, the which did never meete.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Roger le Peynture’ or ‘Henry le Peintur,’ ‘Ralph le
Gilder’ and ‘Robert le Stainer,’ were engaged, I
imagine, in the equally careful work of decorating
passage and hall within, and all have left offspring
enough to keep up their perpetual memorial. Thus,
within and without, the house itself has afforded room
for little change in our nomenclature, though the
artisans themselves have now a very different work to
perform to that of their mediæval prototypes. The
increase of wealth and a progressive culture have not
merely taught but demanded a more careful and
refined workmanship in the details of ordinary housebuilding.
We may readily imagine, however, even in
this early day, how little the simple bondsman, or
freer husbandman, had to do with such artisans as
even then existed. I do not find, at least the exceptions
are of the rarest, that these workmen dwelt in
the more rural districts at all. Their names are to
be met with in the towns, where the richer tradespeople
and burgesses were already beginning to copy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the fashions and habits of life of the higher aristocracy.</p>
<p class='c007'>We have already noticed the ‘town’—how it
originally denoted but the simple farmstead with its
immediate surroundings, then its gradual enlargement
of sense as other steads increased and multiplied
around it. We have also seen how the old ‘ham’ or
home gathered about it such accessions of human
abodes as converted it in time into one of those village
communities, so many of which we still find in the
outer districts, almost, as I have said, unaltered from
their early foundation. It was in these various homesteads
dwelt the peasantry. There might be seen our
‘Cotmans’ and ‘Cotters’ (‘Richard Coteman,’ A.,
‘Simon le Cotere,’ F.F.), the descendants, doubtless,
of the ‘cotmanni’ of Domesday Book. Similar in
origin and as humble in degree would be our now
numerous ‘Cotterels’ or ‘Cottrels’ (‘William Coterel,’
M., ‘Joice Cotterill,’ Z.), till a comparatively recent
period an ordinary sobriquet of that class of
our country population. A curious memorial of a
past state of life abides with us in our ‘Boardmans,’
‘Boarders,’ ‘Bordmans,’ and ‘Borders.’ They were
the tenants of lands which their lord kept expressly
for the maintenance of his table, the rental being paid
in kind. Hence our old English law-books speak
familiarly of bord-service, or bord-load, or bord-land.
The term board in this same sense still lingers on the
common tongue, for we are yet wont to use such
phrases as bed and board, or a frugal board, or a
board plentifully spread. A determinate, as distinct
from an unfixed service, has left its mark in our
‘Sockermans,’ ‘Suckermans,’ and ‘Sockmans,’ they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>who held by socage, or socmanry, as the old law-books
have it. Under this tenure, as a condition of the
meagre rental, the stout-hearted, thick-limbed rustic
was to be ready, as his lord’s adherent, to stand by
him in every assault, either as archer, or arbalister, or
pikeman—that is, fealty was to eke out the remaining
sum which would otherwise have been due. But
there were of these Saxon husbandmen some under
no such thraldom, however honourable, as this, and of
these freeholders we must set as the highest our
‘Yomans’ and ‘Yeomans.’ This term, however, became
an official one, and it is doubtful to which aspect
of the word we are to refer the present owners of the
name. It is possible both features may have had
something to do with its origination. How anxious
they who had been redeemed, or who had been born
free, though of humble circumstances, were to preserve
themselves from a doubtful or suspected position
such names as ‘Walter le Free’ or ‘John le Freman’
will fully show. We find even such appellatives as
‘Matilda Frewoman’ or ‘Agnes Frewyfe,’ in the
latter case the husband possibly being yet in bondage.
In our ‘Frys,’ a sobriquet that has acquired
much honour of late years and represented in mediæval
rolls by such entries as ‘Thomas le Frye’ or
‘Walter le Frie,’ we have but an obsolete rendering
of ‘free.’<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c009'><sup>[245]</sup></a> These, as we see, are all Saxon—but
Norman equivalents are not wanting. Our ‘Francoms’
or ‘Francombs’ and ‘Frankhams,’ names by
no means uncommon in our existing registers, are but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Anglicised dresses worn by the posterity of such
registered folk as ‘Henry le Franchome,’ or ‘Reginald
le Fraunchome,’ or ‘Hugh le Fraunch-humme.’
‘William le Fraunk,’ too, or ‘Fulco le Franc,’ can
boast many a hale descendant in our ‘Franks;’ and
‘Roger le Franklyn’ or ‘John le Fraunkelyn’ in our
‘Franklins,’ a name from henceforth endeared to
Englishmen as that of our gallant but lost Arctic
hero. From Chaucer’s description of one such we
should deem the ‘franklin’ to have been of decidedly
comfortable position, a well-to-do householder, in
fact.</p>

<p class='c018'>But we are not without vestiges of the baser servitudes

the great bulk of the agricultural classes of the twelfth

<p class='c017'>says an old rhyme.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c009'><sup>[246]</sup></a> Still more general terms for those
who lay under this miserable serfdom were those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>‘Knave’ or ‘Villein.’ ‘Walter le Knave’ or ‘Lambert
le Vilein’ or ‘Philip le Vylayn’ are names registered
at the time of which we are speaking. The odium,
however, that has gradually gathered around these
sobriquets has caused them to be thrown off by the
posterity of those who first acquired them as simple
bondmen. Indeed, there was the time when, as I
shall have occasion to show in a succeeding chapter,
our forefathers could speak of ‘Goodknaves’ and
‘Goodvilleins.’ Feudal disdain of all that lay beneath
chivalric service, however, has done its work, and we
all now speak, not merely as if these terms implied
that which was mean and despicable in outward condition,
but that which also was morally depraved and
vile. ‘Geoffrey le Sweyn’ or ‘Hugh le Sweyn,’ however,
by becoming the exponent of honest rusticity,
has rescued his sobriquet from such an ill-merited
destiny, and has left in many of our ‘Swains’ a token
of his mediæval gallantry. ‘John le Hyne’ or
‘William le Hyne’ (found also as Hind), as representative
of the country labourer, is equally sure of perpetuity,
as the most cursory survey of our directories
will prove.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c009'><sup>[247]</sup></a> Of the ‘Reve’ in the ‘Canterbury
Tales,’ we are told:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There was no bailif, nor herd, nor other hine</div>
      <div class='line'>That he nor knew his sleight, and his covine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the ‘Townley Mysteries,’ too, the word occurs. In
the account of the reconciliation betwixt Jacob and
Esau the former is made to say:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>God yeld you, brother, that it so is,</div>
      <div class='line'>That thou thy hyne so would kiss.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>In the rural habitations we have mentioned, then
dwelt these various members of the lower class community.</p>
<p class='c007'>The sobriquets we have just briefly surveyed, however,
are of a more general character. We must now,
and as briefly, scan some of those which in themselves
imply the particular service which as rustic labourers
their first owners performed, and by which the titles
were got. This class is well represented by such a
name as ‘Plowman.’ Langland, when he would take
from a peasant point of view a sarcastic survey of the
low morality of his time, as exemplified in the English
Church ere yet she was reformed, could fix upon
no better sobriquet than that of ‘Piers Plowman,’ and
has thus given a prominence to the name it can never
lose. What visions of homely and frugal content we
discern in the utterance of such a surname as this;
what thoughts of healthy life, such as are becoming
rarer with each returning year—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For times are altered—trade’s unfeeling train</div>
      <div class='line'>Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It was with him at early dawn would issue forth our
‘Tillyers’ or ‘Tillmans,’ to help him cleave the furrow.
A little later on we might have seen our
‘Mowers’ and ‘Croppers’<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c009'><sup>[248]</sup></a> hanging up their scythes
and sickles, as the autumn, in richly clad garb, passed
slowly by. Then again in due season busy enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>would be the ‘Dyker,’ now spelt ‘Dicker,’<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c009'><sup>[249]</sup></a> and the
‘Dykeman’ or ‘Dickman.’ With what an enviable
appetite would these eat up to the last relic their
rasher of bacon and black bread, and quaff their home-brewed
ale, a princely feast after the hard toil of
draining the field. To dike was merely to dig, the
root being the same. Of the kindly plowman Chaucer
says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He would thresh, and thereto dike and delve,</div>
      <div class='line'>For Christ’s sake, for every poor wight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Withouten hire, if it lay in his might.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The Malvern dreamer, too, speaks in the same fashion
of ‘dikeres and delvers,’ and among other characters
introduces to our notice ‘Daw the Dykere,’ ‘Daw’
being, as I have already shown, but the shorter David.
Our ‘Drayners,’ I need not add, were but his compeers
in the same labour. Perhaps one of the most
beautiful features that help to make up a truly English
rural landscape is the hedgerows, following the
windings of our lanes, and mazy bypaths skirting our
meadows. England is eminently a land of enclosures.
Still all this has been the result of progressing time.
If our pinder be now an obsolete officership it is
because the lines of appropriation have become more
clearly marked. It is only thus we can understand
the importance of his position in every rural community
four or five hundred years ago. No wonder,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>then, our ‘Hedgers’ and ‘Hedgmans’ are to be found
whose ancestors were once occupied in setting up
these pretty barriers. An old song of James I.’s day
says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Come all you farmers out of the country,</div>
      <div class='line'>Carters, ploughmen, <i>hedgers</i>, and all;</div>
      <div class='line'>Tom, Dick, and Will, Ralph, Roger, and Humphrey,</div>
      <div class='line'>Leave off your gestures rusticall.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c009'><sup>[250]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>If stakes or pales were used, it is to our ‘Pallisers’ and
obsolete ‘Herdleres’ our forefathers looked to set
them up. The former term I have but come across
once as an absolute surname, but such entries as
‘Robert Redman, palayser,’ or ‘James Foster, palycer,’
are to be met with occasionally, and at once
testify to the origin of the term as found in our existing
registers. ‘Pallister,’ too, is not obsolete; strictly
speaking, the feminine form of the above. I find it
written ‘Pallyster’ and ‘Palyster’ in an old Yorkshire
inventory. But there is one more term belonging to
this group which I am afraid has disappeared from
our family nomenclature—that of ‘Tiner,’ he who
tined or mended hedges. A ‘John le Tynere’ occurs
in the Parliamentary Writs. We are reminded by
Verstigan’s book on ‘Decayed Intelligence’ that
‘hedging and tining’ was a phrase in vogue not more
than 200 years ago. Mr. Taylor, in his ‘Words and
Places,’ connects our ‘tine’ in the ‘tines of a stag’s
horns’ or ‘the tines of a fork,’ with the same root
implying a ‘twig.’ In our old English forest law a
‘tineman’ was an officer very similar to the ‘hayward,’
the only apparent difference being that he served by
night. The two terms are exactly similar in sense.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>We are not without relics, too, of our former means
and methods of enriching the glebe. Even here
several interesting memorials are preserved to us.
‘Marler,’<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c009'><sup>[251]</sup></a> ‘Clayer,’ and ‘Chalker’ (‘Alice le
Marlere,’ A., ‘Thomas le Chalker,’ A., ‘Simon le
Clayere,’ A.), still existing, remind us how commonly
the land was manured with marl and other substances
of a calcareous nature. Trevisa, writing upon this
very subject, says—‘Also in this land (England),
under the turf of the land, is good marl found. The
thrift of the fatness drieth himself (itself) therein, so
that even the thicker the field is marled, the better
corn will it bear.’<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c009'><sup>[252]</sup></a> An old rhyme says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He that marles sand may buy land;</div>
      <div class='line'>He that marles moss shall suffer no loss;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he that marles clay throws all away.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>An interesting surname of this class is that of ‘Acreman,’
or, as it is now generally spelt, ‘Acherman,’
‘Akerman,’ or ‘Aikman,’ for it is far from being of
modern German introduction, as some have supposed.
In the Hundred Rolls and elsewhere it appears in
such entries as ‘Alexander le Acherman,’ ‘Roger le
Acreman,’ ‘Peter le Akerman,’ and ‘John le Akurman.’
His was indeed a common and familiar sobriquet, and
we are but once more reminded by it of the day when
the <i>acre</i> was what it really denoted—the ager, or land
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>open to tillage, without thought of definite or statute
measure. Indeed, it is quite possible the term was at
first strictly applied thus, for a contemporaneous poem
has the following couplet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The foules up, and song on bough,</div>
      <div class='line'>And acremen yede to the plough.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>If this be the case the surname is but synonymous
with ‘Plowman’ and ‘Tillman,’ already referred to.</p>
<p class='c007'>A curious name is found in the writs of this period,
and one well worthy of mention, that of ‘Adam le
Imper.’ An ‘imp,’ I need scarcely remind the reader,
was originally a ‘scion’ or ‘offshoot,’ whether of
plants or animals, the former seemingly most common,
to judge from instances. That nothing more
than this was intended by it we may prove by Archbishop
Trench’s quotation from Bacon, where he
speaks of ‘those most virtuous and goodly young
imps, the Duke of Suffolk and his brother.’<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c009'><sup>[253]</sup></a> Chaucer
says that of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>feble trees their comen wretched imps—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and ‘Piers Plowman’ uses the word still more explicitly—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I was some tyme a frere</div>
      <div class='line'>And the conventes gardyner</div>
      <div class='line'>For to graffen impes,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>he says. This latter quotation explains the surname.
‘Imper,’ doubtless, simply differed from ‘Gardiner’ or
‘Gardner’ in that he was more particularly engaged
in the grafting of young shoots.</p>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>From the consideration of the last we may fitly
turn to the subject of fruits. There can be no doubt
that in early days, so far at least as the south, and
more particularly the south-west of England was concerned,
the vine was very generally cultivated by the
peasantry, and the wine made therefrom, however
poor it might be, used by them. So early as Domesday
Survey a ‘Walter Vinitor’ lived in Surrey, and a
century or two later such names as ‘Symon le Vynur,’
or ‘William le Viner,’ or ‘Roger le Vynour,’ the ancestry
of our ‘Viners,’ show that the vine-dresser’s
occupation was not yet extinct. We have long left
the production of this beverage, however, to the sunnier
champaign lands of the Continent, and are content
by paying a higher price to get a richer and
fuller juice. Our ‘Dressers’ may either belong to
this or the curriers’ fraternity. An old poem, which
I have already had occasion to quote, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In tyme of harvest merry it is enough,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pears and apples hangeth on bough,</div>
      <div class='line'>The hayward bloweth merry his horne,</div>
      <div class='line'>In every felde ripe is corne,</div>
      <div class='line'>The grapes hongen on the vyne,</div>
      <div class='line'>Swete is trewe love and fyne.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We have here the mention of pears and apples. The
cultivation of these by our ‘Orcharders,’ or ‘de la
Orchards,’ or ‘de la Apelyards,’ was a familiar occupation,
and ‘le Cyderer,’<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c009'><sup>[254]</sup></a> and ‘le Perriman,’ or ‘Pearman,’
and ‘le Perrer,’ testify readily as to the use to
which they were put. The home-made drinks of
these early days were almost all sweet. Such decoctions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>as mead, piment, or hippocras, in the absence of
sugar, were mingled with honey. We can at once
understand, therefore, what an important pursuit
would that be of the bee-keeper.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c009'><sup>[255]</sup></a> Not merely did
the occasional husbandman possess his two or three
hives, but there were those who gave themselves up
wholly to the tendence of bees, and who made for
themselves a comfortable livelihood in the sale of
their produce. Many of our surnames still bear testimony
to this. ‘Beman,’ or ‘Beeman,’ or ‘Beaman,’
will be familiar to all, and ‘Honeyman’ is scarcely
less common. In an old roll of 1183 we have the
name Latinised in such an entry as ‘Ralph Custosapium.’
But not merely honey, but spices of all kinds
were also infused into these various drinks, whether
of wine or ale. We have a well-drawn picture of this
in Piers Plowman’s vision where ‘Glutton’ comes
across Beton the Brewstere, and the latter bidding
him good-morrow, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I have good ale, gossib,’ quoth she,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Glutton, wilt thou assaye?’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Hast thou aught in thy purse,’ quoth he;</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Any hote spices?’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘I have pepir, and peonies,’ quoth she,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘And a pound of garleck,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a farthing-worth of fenel-seed</div>
      <div class='line'>For fastyng dayes.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Such an array of hot ingredients as this poor Glutton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>could not resist, and instead of going to Mass he
turned into the tavern, and having supped</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A galon and a gille,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>of course got uproariously drunk. Thus we see how
natural it is we should come across such names as
‘Balmer,’ or ‘le Oyncterer,’ or ‘le Hoincter,’ as it is
also registered, or ‘le Garlyckmonger,’ in our early
records. The first still exists. The second does not,
but the cumbersome and ungainly appearance of the
last affords sufficient excuse for its absence. It is
quite possible, however, that our ‘Garlicks’ are but a
curtailment of it, and this is the more likely, as such
forms as ‘Henry le Garleckmonger,’ or ‘Thomas le
Garlykmonger,’ are commonly found, and evidently
represented an important occupation. The Normans,
like the Saxons, loved a highly stimulative dish, and
garlic sauce went to everything; bird, beast, fish, all
alike found their seasoning in a concoction of which
this acrid and pungent herb was the chief ingredient.
‘Roger le Gaderer,’ or as we should now say
‘Gatherer,’ has left no descendant, but he may be
mentioned as representing a more general term for
many of the above.</p>
<p class='c007'>In the woodlands and its open glades and devious
windings, where several of these herbalists I have
mentioned would be often found, we shall see, too,
other frequenters. It would be here, subject to the condition
of agistment and pannage, our ‘Swinnarts,’ or
swineherds, tended their hogs. It would be here by
the hazel bank and deeper forest pathways our ‘Nutters’
and ‘Nutmans’ would be found, as the autumn
began to set in, and browner and more golden tints
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>to fleck the trees and hedgerows. It would be here,
as the chills of early winter drew on, and the fallen
leaves lay strewn around, our ‘Bushers’ or ‘Boshers’
(relics of the old ‘John le Busscher’ or ‘Reginald le
Buscher’), and our more Saxon ‘Thomas le Woderes,’
‘Robert Wudemongers,’ and ‘Alan le Wodemans’
(now ‘Woodyers’ and ‘Woodmans’), would be occupied
in gathering the refuse branches for firing
purposes—here our ‘Hewers’ (once found as ‘Ralph
le Heuer’) and more specific ‘Robert le Wodehewers,’<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c009'><sup>[256]</sup></a>
our ‘Hackers’ and ‘Hackmans,’ would be
engaged in chopping timber, perchance for building
purposes, perchance for our ‘Ashburners,’<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c009'><sup>[257]</sup></a> to
procure their potash from. Oftentimes, no doubt,
would these various frequenters of the woodland boscage
be roused from their rude labours to watch as
the hornblower (now ‘Hornblow’) awoke the shrill
echoes, the lordly chase sweep through the glade till
it was hidden by the embrasures of the forest, or the
darkening twilight, or the bending hill.</p>

<p class='c007'>One single glance backward over the names we
have so far recorded in this chapter, and one thing
will be obvious—their all but entirely Saxon character.
Our agriculture terms, whether with regard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>to the work itself or the labourer, belong to the
earlier tongue. There is nothing surprising in this.
While in the nomenclature of trade we find the
superior force and energy of the Norman temperament
struggling with and oftentimes overcoming the
more sober humour of the conquered race, in the
country and all the pursuits of the country the latter
was far ahead of its rival. It was better versed in
agricultural pursuits, and ever retained them in its
own hands. At the same time, as we well know, this
very detention was but the mark of its defeat and
the badge of its slavery. It was a victory where,
nevertheless, all is lost. Wamba the jester, in
‘Ivanhoe,’ if I may be excused such a trite illustration,
reminds us that our cattle, while in the field, and
under the guardianship of the enslaved Saxon, were
called by the Saxon terms of ‘ox,’ ‘sheep,’ and
‘calf,’ but served upon the tables of their lords
became Norman ‘beef,’ ‘mutton,’ and ‘veal’—that
is, while the former <i>fed them</i>, the latter it was that
<i>fed on them</i>. Thus in the same way, if those homely
pursuits which attached to the tilling of the soil,
the breeding of cattle, the gathering in and the
storing of the harvest—if these maintained the terms
which belonged to them ere the Conquest, they are so
many marks of serfdom. Provided the supply on
his board was only profuse enough, the proud baron
troubled himself little as to the supplier, or how or
under what names it was procured. See how true
this is from our nomenclature. There is a little word
which has dropped from our lips which once played
an important part in our vocabulary—I mean that of
‘herd’—not as applied to the flock, but the keeper.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>We still use it familiarly in compounds, such as
<i>swineherd</i> or <i>shepherd</i>, but that it once had a separate
existence of its own is proved by the many ‘Heards,’
or ‘Herds,’ or ‘Hurds,’ that still abound surnominally
in our midst; relics as they are of the
‘John le Hirdes,’ or ‘Alice la Herdes,’ or ‘Robert
le Hyrdes,’ of our olden records. Chaucer so uses it.
We now speak of our Lord as the ‘Good Shepherd.’
He, however, gives us the simpler form where St.
Urban is made to say—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Almighty Lord, O Jesu Christ,’ quoth he,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Sower of chaste counsel, herd of us all.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus again, in the ‘Townley Mysteries’ the angel
who visited the shepherds as they kept their flocks by
night is represented as arousing them by saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Herkyn, hyrdes, awake!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>See now the many compounds of which this purely
Saxon word is the root. Are we in the low-lying
pastures. In our ‘Stotherds’ and ‘Stothards,’ our
‘Stoddarts’ and ‘Stoddards,’ still clings the remembrance
of the old <i>stot</i> or bullock-herd; in our
‘Yeatherds’ (as in our ‘Yeatmans’), the heifer herd;
and in our ‘Cowards,’ far from being so pusillanimous
as they look, the homely ‘cowherd.’ In
‘William and the Werfolf’ we are told—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It bifel in that forest</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There fast byside,</div>
      <div class='line'>There woned (dwelt) a wel old churl</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That was a couherde.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Nor are these all. In our ‘Calverts’ and ‘Calverds’
we are reminded of the once well-known ‘Warin le
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Calveherd,’ or ‘William le Calverd,’ as I find him
recorded; in our ‘Nuttards’ the more general but now
faded ‘neteherd’ or ‘noutherd,’<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c009'><sup>[258]</sup></a> and in our obsolete
‘John Oxenhyrds’ and ‘Peter Oxherds,’ the familiar
ox. Are we in the grazing paddock. In our ‘Coultherds,’
‘Coulthards,’ and ‘Coultards’ (‘John Colthird,’
W. 9), not to mention our ‘Coultmans’ and ‘Coltmans,’
we have ample trace of their presence. Are we again
on the bleak hill-side. The sheep have given us our
‘Shepherds,’ the rams our ‘Wetherherds’ (now generally
written ‘Weatherheads’), the kids our ‘Gottards,’
not to say some of our ‘Goddards,’ memorials of the
once common goatherd. Are we under the woodland
pathways where the beech-nuts abound. There, too,
the herd was to be found, for in our ‘Swinnarts,’
‘Hoggarts,’ and ‘Sowards’ we are not without a
further token of his usefulness. In three instances I
have found ‘herd’ connected with the winged
creation. In the <i>Parliamentary Writs</i> occurs ‘William
le Swonherde,’ in the <i>Corpus Christi Guild</i>
(Surt. Soc.), ‘Agnes Gusehyrd’ and ‘Joan Gusehyrd,’
and in the <i>Hundred Rolls</i> ‘Henry le Rocherde,’
<i>i.e.</i>, rook-herd.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c009'><sup>[259]</sup></a> ‘Swanherd’ reminds us that swans
were an important article of diet in early times. In
1482 an Act was passed forbidding any but freeholders
(and they only if they had lands of the annual
value of five marks) to have marks or games of
swans. (‘Stat. Realm,’ vol. ii. p. 447.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>It will have already become clear to the reader
that this term ‘herd’ played no unimportant part
in the vocabulary of the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. But even now we have not done. For
instance, our ‘Stobbarts’ and ‘Stubbards’ are
manifestly descendants of such a name as ‘Alice
Stobhyrd’ or ‘Thomas Stobart,’ the owners of both of
which are set down in the Black Book of Hexham
Priory in company with ‘John Stodard,’ ‘William
Oxhyrd,’ and ‘Thomas Schipherde.’<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c009'><sup>[260]</sup></a> I should have
been in some difficulty in regard to the meaning of
this ‘stob’ or ‘stub’ had not Mr. Halliwell in his
dictionary of archaic words given it as an old rural
term for a bull. This surname, therefore, is satisfactorily
accounted for. I cannot be quite so positive
with regard to our ‘Geldards’ and ‘Geldarts,’ but I
strongly suspect their early ancestor was but a
<i>confrère</i> of the swineherd or hogherd, ‘gelt,’ or ‘geld,’
as a porcine title, being a familiar word to our
forefathers of that date. Our ‘Gattards’ and
‘Gathards,’ too, may be mentioned as but mediævalisms
for the goatherd, ‘Gateard’ and ‘Gatherd’
being met with in North English records contemporaneously
with the above. Such a sobriquet as
‘Adam le Gayt,’ while it may be but a form of the
old ‘wayt’ or watchman, is, I imagine, but representative
of this northern provincialism. It occurs
locally in ‘William de Gatesden’ or ‘John de Gatesden,’
both found in the Parliamentary Writs. With
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>two more instances I will conclude. In our ‘Hunnards’
still lives the memory of ‘Helyas le Hunderd,’
the old houndsman, while in ‘Richard le Wodehirde’
or ‘William le Wodehirde’ we have but another,
though more general, sobriquet of one of those many
denizens of the forest I have already hinted at. How
purely Saxon are all these names! What a freshness
seems to breathe about them! What a fragrance as
of the wild heather and thyme, and all that is sweet
and fresh and free! And yet they are but so many
marks of serfdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have just incidentally referred to the swineherd.
It is difficult for us, in this nineteenth century of ours,
to conceive the vast importance of this occupation in
the days of which we are writing. Few avocations
have so much changed as this. Hog-tending as a
distinct livelihood is well-nigh extinct. Time was,
however, when the rustic community lived upon
bacon, when the surveillance of swine was a lazy,
maybe, but nevertheless an all-important care. We
still speak of a ‘flitch of bacon,’ a term which, while
etymologically the same as ‘flesh,’ shows how to the
early popular mind that article represented the sum
total of <i>carnal</i> luxuries. Our use of the word
‘brawn’ is of an equally tell-tale character. Every
one knows what we mean by brawn. Originally, however,
it was the flesh of any animal. Chaucer says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Miller was a stout carl for the nones,</div>
      <div class='line'>Full big he was of brawn, and eke of bones.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>When, however, the wild boar had been brought
down, and salted, and put aside for winter use, how
natural that to the housewife it should engross this
general sense. It is to the importance this unsavoury-looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>animal held in the eyes of early rustics we
must attribute the fact of so many names coming
down to us connected with its keep. As I have just
hinted, such sobriquets as ‘John le Swineherd’ or
‘Nicholas le Hogherd’ were common enough in
the country parts, our ‘Swinnarts’ and ‘Hoggarts’
being witnesses. The sowherd remains in our
‘Sowards,’ and is as Saxon as the others. The same
tongue is strong again in our ‘Pigmans’ ‘Sowmans,’
‘Hogmans,’ and still more secluded ‘Denyers’ and
‘Denmans.’ The Norman, however, is to be accredited
with our many ‘Gilbert le Porchers’ and
‘Thomas le Porkeres,’ by which we may see that
when daintily served up under the name of ‘pork’ it
was not disdained on the baron’s table. Lastly, we
may mention our early ‘Philip le Lardiners’ and
‘Hugh le Lardiners,’ names that in themselves suggest
to us the one purpose of the herdsman, the
fattening of his charge. They would be found
generally, therefore, neath the fastnesses of the forest,
where the</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oak with his nuts larded many a swine,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and where the mast and beech-nuts abounded, the
chief pannage, it would seem, of that day.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c009'><sup>[261]</sup></a> Higher up,
as far indeed as the bleak and barren wolds, the
shepherd cared for and tended his flock. His was a
common occupation, too, as our nomenclature shows.
Evidently he was as prone in those days to the oaten
reed as the poets of all ages have loved to depict him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>for it is to his Norman-introduced name of ‘Berger’
we owe the ‘bergeret,’ or pastoral ode. The song
indeed, so called, has died away from our ears, but
‘Berger,’ or ‘Bercher,’ as it was often written, still
lives, and may carry us back for a moment to these
wholesomer times.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor, if we approach more closely to the farmyard
enclosure, are we without memorials. The <i>farm</i> of
old, as applied to the soil, was of course that piece of
land which was rented for agricultural purposes, and
I doubt not the chief of the old ‘Robert le Fermers’
and ‘Matilda le Fermeres’ represent this more confined
sense. ‘Farmer,’ whether colloquially or in our
registers, is the modern form. Udal, however, maintains
the more antique dress, when he says, ‘And
that the thyng should so be, Chryst Hymself had
signyfied to fore by the parable of the husbandmen
or fermers.’</p>

<p class='c007'>While ‘herd,’ as a root-word, implied the tendance
of cattle in the meadows and woods and on the hillsides,
‘man,’ I suspect, was equally significative of
their guardianship in the stable and the yard. Thus
if the ‘<i>cowherd</i>’ was in the field, the ‘<i>cowman</i>’ would
be in the stall. We may here, therefore, set our
familiar ‘Cowmans,’ ‘Bullmans,’ ‘Heiffermans,’ and
‘Steermans,’ or ‘Stiermans.’<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c009'><sup>[262]</sup></a> One or two provincialisms,
I imagine, have added also to this stock. Mr.
Lower thinks our ‘Twentymans’ to be derived from
‘Vintenarius,’ a captain of twenty. This may be so,
but I suspect the more correct origin will be found in
‘twenterman’ or ‘twinterman,’ he who tended the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>‘<i>twenters</i>’ or ‘<i>twinters</i>,’ the old and once familiar
‘two-winter,’ or, as we now generally say, ‘two-year-old.’
If the ‘steer,’ the ‘heifer,’ the ‘cow,’ and the
‘bull’ gave a sobriquet to the farm labourer, why not
this? As a farmyard term it occurs in every provincial
record of the fifteenth and even sixteenth
century. Thus, to quote but one instance, I find in
a will dated 1556 mention made of ‘6 oxen, item,
18 sterres (steers), item, 11 heifers, item, 21 twenters,
item, 23 stirks.’ (Richmondshire Wills, p. 93.) An
inventory of the same date includes ‘3 kye, item, one
whye.’ This latter term was equally commonly used
at this period for a ‘heifer.’ Our ‘Whymans’ and
‘Wymans’ will, we may fairly surmise, be their present
memorial. ‘Cowman,’ mentioned above, was
met by the Norman ‘Vacher,’ such entries as ‘John
le Vacher’ or ‘Walter le Vacher’ being common, and
as ‘Vacher,’ or more corruptly ‘Vatcher,’ it still abides
in our midst. ‘Thomas le Stabeler,’ or ‘William le
Stabler,’ too, are yet with us; but descendants for
‘Thomas le Milkar’ or ‘William le Melker’ are, I
fear, wanting. A Norman representative for these
latter is found in the Parliamentary Writs in the case
of ‘John le Lacter.’ There is the smack of a kindred
labour in the registered ‘Thomas le Charner,’ for I
doubt not his must have been but an antique dress of
‘Churner.’ Another form is found in an old Richmondshire
will dated 1592, where mention is made of
‘Robert Chirner’ and his sister ‘Jane Chirner.’ As
an additional proof that his occupation was such as I
have surmised, I may add that in the same record in
the valuation of household property the <i>churn</i> is spelt
<i>chirne</i>. (Richmondshire Wills, p. 235, note.) The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>most interesting sobriquet of this class, and the one
which has left the most memorials, is found in such
mediæval names as ‘Cecilia le Day,’ or ‘Christiana la
Daye,’ or ‘Stephen le Dagh.’ A ‘day’ was a dairyman,
of which word it is but another form. Chaucer,
in one of the most charming of his descriptions, tells
us of a poor widow, how that she—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Since that day that she was last a wife</div>
      <div class='line'>In patience led a ful simple life,</div>
      <div class='line'>For litel was her cattle, and her rent:</div>
      <div class='line'>By husbandry of such as God her sent</div>
      <div class='line'>She found herself and eke her doughtren two.</div>
      <div class='line in5'>————</div>
      <div class='line'>Her board was served most with white and black,</div>
      <div class='line'>Milk and brown bread, in which she found no lack,</div>
      <div class='line'>Singed bacon, and sometimes an egg or twey,</div>
      <div class='line'>For she was as it were a maner <i>dey</i>.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c009'><sup>[263]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The present representatives of this name are met
with in the several forms of ‘Deye,’ ‘Daye,’ ‘Day,’
‘Dayman,’ and the more unpleasantly corrupted
‘Deman.’</p>
<p class='c007'>It is quite evident, judging from the places of
abode in which we find our early ‘Fishers’ and
‘Fishermans,’ that it is to followers, though professional,
of the quaint and gentle-minded Izaac Walton
we owe our many possessors of these names, rather
than to the dwellers upon the coast, although both,
doubtless, are represented. Such entries as ‘Margaret
le Fischere,’ or ‘Henry le Fissere,’ or ‘Robert le Fiscere’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>are very common. This latter seems a sort of
medium between the others and such a more hard
form as ‘Laurence le Fisker.’ The finny species
themselves gave us such sobriquets as ‘John le
Fysche’ or ‘William Fyske,’ and both ‘Fish’ and
‘Fisk’ still exist amongst us. The Norman angler
is seen in ‘Godard le Pescher’ or ‘Walter le Pecheur,’
while ‘Agnes le Pecheresse’ bespeaks the fact that
even women did not disdain the gentle art.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the moment we hint of the village streamlet
we are thrown upon a subject vast indeed—the mill
and the miller. He was emphatically, you see, <i>the</i>
miller. Even now, in these busy grasping days, when
we have cotton mills and saw mills, silk mills and
powder mills, mills for this and mills for that, still it
never occurs to us, when we talk of the miller, that
any one could possibly mistake our meaning. And
well may it be so, for it is with him we entwine pleasant
remembrances of the country, the wheel, the
stream, the lusty dimpled trout; with him we associate
all of comfortable, peaceful content. A white
jacket and a white cap, with a black coat for Sundays—how
black it would look to be sure—a bluff, good-humoured
face, a friendly nod, and a blithe good-morrow,
up early and to bed betimes, and his memoir
is written, and a very pleasant memoir, too, with a
moral to boot for discontented folk, would they but
see it. The old word for mill was ‘milne,’ hence we
still have the earlier form, ‘Milnes’ and ‘Milner’
being nearly as familiar to us in that respect as
‘Mills’ and ‘Miller.’ Besides these we have ‘Milman’
and ‘Milward,’ who once, no doubt, acted as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>custodian, the modern ‘man on the premises,’ in fact.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c009'><sup>[264]</sup></a>
The ancestry of all these is proved by such registered
forms as ‘John le Mellere,’ ‘William le Melner,’
‘Robert le Milleward,’<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c009'><sup>[265]</sup></a> ‘John del Mill,’ or ‘Thomas
atte Milne,’ all of which are found scattered over our
earlier rolls.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c009'><sup>[266]</sup></a> Our ‘Threshers’ and ‘Taskers’ (Benedict
le Tasker,’ H.R.) busied themselves in urging
the flail. I have only lit upon the latter term once
as in ordinary colloquial use. Burton in the preface
to his ‘Anatomy’ says—‘many poor country-vicars,
for want of other means, are driven to their shifts,’ and
‘as Paul did, at last turn taskers, maltsters, costermongers,
graziers, etc.’<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c009'><sup>[267]</sup></a> Our ‘Winners,’ shortened
from ‘Winnower,’ winnowed the grain with the fan;
our ‘Boulters’ or ‘Bulters,’<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c009'><sup>[268]</sup></a> ‘Siviers’ and ‘Riddlers,’
(‘Geoffrey le Boltere,’ A., ‘William Rydler,’ Z., ‘Ralph
le Siviere,’ A.), still more carefully separated the
flour from the bran. How beautifully Shakespeare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>presses this into his imagery many will remember,
where Florizel speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The fanned snow that’s bolted</div>
      <div class='line'>By the northern blasts twice o’er.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our Bible translators, too, must have yet been familiar
with the simpler process of this earlier time when
they rendered one of the prophet’s happier foretellings
into the beautiful Saxon we still possess:—‘The oxen
likewise, and the young asses that ear the ground
shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed
with the shovel and with the fan.’ The manufacture
or use of the fan wherewith to purge the flour made
our ‘Walter le Vanners,’ ‘Simon le Fanneres,’ ‘Richard
atte Vannes,’ or ‘William atte Fannes,’ familiar names
at this time. In Cocke Lorelle’s Bote, we find among
other craftsmen—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Barbers, bokebynders, and lymners;</div>
      <div class='line'>Repers, <i>faners</i>, and horners.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We must not forget, too, our ‘Shovellers’ and more
common ‘Showlers,’ ‘showl’ being ever the vulgar
form. It was for no purpose of rhyme, only the word
is so used where we are asked—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in9'>‘Who’ll dig his grave?’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘I,’ said the owl; ‘with my spade and showl</div>
      <div class='line in9'>I’ll dig his grave.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>With these many reminders, it is not likely that either
the miller or his men are likely to become soon forgotten.</p>
<p class='c007'>The smithy, of course, was an inseparable adjunct
to the small community. The smith, unlike the
wright, was engaged upon the harder metals, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>latter being incidentally described to us by Chaucer
when he says of one of his personages in the Reeves
Story, that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He was a well good wright, a carpenter.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Looking at the many compounds formed from these
two roots, we find that in the main this distinction
is maintained. Let us take the wright first. We
have but just mentioned ‘Ralph le Siviere,’ or
‘Peter le Syvyere.’ For him our ‘Sivewrights’
were manifestly occupied, to say nothing of the
farmer’s wife. The farmer himself would need the
services of our ‘Plowwrights’ (‘William le Plowritte,’
A., ‘William le Ploughwryte,’ M.), and would he carry
his produce safely to the distant market or fair he
must needs have a good stout wain, for the track
athwart the hillside was rough and uneven, and here
therefore he must call into requisition the skill of our
many ‘Wheelwrights,’ or ‘Wheelers,’ ‘Cartwrights’
and their synonymous ‘Wainwrights.’<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c009'><sup>[269]</sup></a> Adding to
these ‘Boatwright,’ or ‘Botwright,’ ‘Shipwright,’ and
the obsolete ‘Slaywright,’ the old loom manufacturer,
we see wood to have been the chief object at least
of the wright’s attention. But we have other names
of a different character. ‘Limewright’ or ‘Limer’
(‘Hugh le Limwryte,’ A., ‘John le Limer,’ A.) ceases
to maintain this distinction, so do our ‘Glasswrights,’
equivalent to our ‘Glaziers’ or ‘Glaishers’ (‘Thomas
le Glaswryghte,’ X., ‘Walter Glasenwryht,’ W. ii.,
‘William Glaseer,’ Z.).<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c009'><sup>[270]</sup></a> ‘Le Cheesewright,’ or ‘Chesswright,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>like ‘Firminger’ and ‘Casier,’ brings us once
more into the scullery, and ‘Breadwright’ into the
kitchen. ‘Alwright’ is doubtless but the old ‘alewright,’
and ‘Goodwright,’ which Mr. Lower deems to be
a maker of goads, I cannot but imagine to be simply
complimentary, after the fashion of many others which
I shall mention in another chapter. Our ‘Tellwrights’
or ‘Telwrights’ have given me much trouble, and
though at first I did not like it, I think Mr. Lower’s
suggestion that they have arisen from the Pauline
occupation of tent-making is a natural one. ‘Teld’
was the old English word for a tent. In the metrical
Anglo-Saxon Psalter the fourteenth psalm thus commences—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lord, in thi teld wha sal wone (dwell)?</div>
      <div class='line'>In thi hali hille or wha reste mone (shall)?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We still speak of a ‘tilt’ when referring to the cover
of a cart or wagon, or to any small awning of a boat.
It is quite possible, therefore, that the name has originated
in the manufacture of such canopies as these.
Admitting this, I would merely suggest ‘Tilewright’
as requiring but little corruptive influence to bring it
into the forms in which we at present find the word.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c009'><sup>[271]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Should this be the case, we must place it with ‘le Tyler,’
of whom we have but recently spoken. ‘Arkwright’ I
mention last as being worthy of more extended notice.
In this is preserved the memory of a once familiar and
all-important piece of cabinet furniture—that of the
old-fashioned ark. Much store was set by this long
years ago by the north-country folk, as is shown by
the position it occupies in antique wills, often being
found as the first legacy bequeathed.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c009'><sup>[272]</sup></a> Shaped
exactly like the child’s Noah’s ark, it seems to have
had a twofold character. In one it was simply a
meal-bin. Thus in the ‘Tale of a Usurer’ we are
told:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When this corn to the kniht was sold,</div>
      <div class='line'>He did it in an arc to hold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And opened this arc the third day.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the other it was more carefully put together. The
trick of its secret spring, known only to the housewife
and her lord—sometimes I dare say, only to the
latter—it contained all the treasure the family could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>boast. Here were kept what parchments they possessed;
here lay stored up fold on fold of household
linen, venerated by the female inmates nearly as
much as the grandmothers themselves, whose thrifty
fingers had woven it in days long past and gone. We
see thus that upon the whole the wright <i>wrought</i> his
manufacture out of his own more specific material,
seldom, at any rate, poaching upon the preserves of
his friend the smith. The smith worked in iron and
the metals. This good old Saxon name, with the
many quaint changes that have been rung upon it,
deserves a whole chapter to itself. How then can we
hope to do justice to it in a few sentences? We do
not know where to begin, and having once begun, the
difficulty at once arises as to where we can end. How
few of us reflect upon the close connexion that exists
between the anvil and the smith himself, and yet it is
because he <i>smote</i> thereupon that he got his name.
As old Verstigan has it:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From whence comes Smith, all be he knight or squire,</div>
      <div class='line'>But from the smith that forgeth at the fire?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Putting in all the needs which in this agricultural age
his occupation would be necessary to supply, still we
could scarcely account for the enormous preponderance
he has attained over other artisans, did we
not remember that his services would also be required
in the production of warlike implements. Sword and
ploughshare alike would be to his hands. Chaucer
speaks of:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line in23'>The smith</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Between and including the years 1838 and 1854 there
were registered as born, or married, or dead, no less
than 286,307 Smiths. Were we indeed to put into
one community the persons who bear this name in
our land, we should have a town larger than Leeds,
and scarcely inferior in size and importance to that of

<p class='c007'>The smith is often spoken of colloquially as the
blacksmith, a title which, while it has not itself a place
in our nomenclature, reminds us of others that have,
and of a peculiar custom of earlier days. The word
‘blacksmith’ dates from the days of ‘Cocke Lorelle’s
Bote,’ and it is quite evident that at that time it was customary
for the smith to have his name compounded
with sobriquets according to the colour of the metal
upon which he spent his energies. Thus the former
‘Thomas Brownesmythe’ evidently worked in copper
and brass, ‘William le Whytesmyth’ in tinplate, ‘John
Redesmith’ in gold, a ‘Goldsmith’ in fact; ‘Richard
Grensmythe’ in I am not sure what, unless it be lead;
and ‘John Blackesmythe’ in iron. The last is the only
one I fail to discover as now existing among our surnames—a
circumstance, however, easily accounted for
from the settled position the simple ‘Smith’ himself had
obtained as an artificer of that metal. But these are not
the only compounds. Our ‘Smiths’ are surrounded
with connexions of not merely every hue, but every
type. Thus ‘Arrowsmith,’ already alluded to with its
contracted ‘Arsmith,’ tells its own tale of archery service;
‘Billsmith’ and ‘Spearsmith’ remind us of the
lances, or rather lance heads, that did such duty in
the golden days of Agincourt and Poictiers. Of a
more peaceful nature would be the work of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>‘Nasmyths,’ like our ‘Naylors,’ mere relics of the old
nailsmith. Closely connected with them, therefore,
we may set our ‘Shoosmiths,’<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c009'><sup>[273]</sup></a> but Saxon representatives
of the Norman-introduced ‘Farrier.’ The surname
still clings chiefly to the north of England,
where the Saxon, retaining so much more of its
strength and vigour than in the south, preserved it as
the occupative term for centuries. Springtide and the
approach of sheep-washing would see our ‘Sheersmiths’
busy, while the later autumn would have its
due effect upon the trade of our ‘Sixsmiths’ and
‘Sucksmiths,’ pleasant though curiously corrupted
memorials of the old sicklesmith, or ‘Sykelsmith,’ as
I find the name spelt. The bucklesmith (‘John le
Bokelsmythe,’ X.), whose name is referred to in the
poem I have but recently quoted, has similarly and
as naturally curtailed himself to ‘Bucksmith.’<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c009'><sup>[274]</sup></a> Our
‘Bladesmiths’ fashioned swords, being found generally
in fellowship with our ‘Cutlers’ and obsolete ‘Knyfesmythes.’
Our ‘Locksmiths,’ of course, looked to the
security of door, and closet, and cupboard;<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c009'><sup>[275]</sup></a> while
our ‘Minsmiths’ (‘John le Mynsmuth,’ M.), for I
believe they are not as yet quite obsolete, hard at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>work in the mint smithy, forged the coin for the early
community. As, however, I shall have occasion to
refer to him again I shall merely cite him, and pass
on.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c009'><sup>[276]</sup></a> But we may see from the little I have said that
the smith never need fear obsoletism. Apart from
his own immediate circle, he is surrounded by many,
if not needy, yet closely attached relatives. We must
not forget, however, that the Norman had his smith,
too, and though the Saxon, as we have thus seen, has
ever maintained his dignity and position, still our
early rolls are not without a goodly number of ‘Adam
le Fevres,’ ‘Richard le Fevers,’ or ‘Reginald le Feures,’
and their cognate ‘Alan le Ferons’ and ‘Roger le
Feruns.’ Representatives of all these, minus the
article, may be readily met with to-day in any of the
large towns of our country.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may take this opportunity of saying a word
about lead, inasmuch as the uses to which it was put
made the manufacturer therein familiar to rural
society. The leadbeater, in fact, was all-important to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the farmer’s wife and the dairy, for the vessels which
held the milk, as it underwent its various processes
until it was turned out into butter, were commonly his
handiwork. Such names as ‘Gonnilda le Leadbetre,’
or ‘Reginald le Ledbeter,’ we find in every considerable
roll, and our modern ‘Leadbeaters,’ ‘Ledbetters,’
‘Leadbitters,’ ‘Lidbetters,’ and probably ‘Libertys,’
are but their descendants. That mixture of lead with
brass or copper which went by the term of ‘latten’ or
‘laton’ has left in our ‘Latoners’ and ‘Latners’ a
memorial of the metal of which our old country
churchyard tablets were made, not to say some of the
household utensils just referred to. We find even
more costly and ornamental ware manufactured of
this, for among other relics preserved by the pardoner,
Chaucer tells us:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He had a gobbet (piece) of the sail</div>
      <div class='line'>That seint Peter had, when that he went</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the sea, till Jesu Christ him hent.</div>
      <div class='line'>He had a cross of laton, full of stones,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in a glass he had pig’s bones.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Such a name then as ‘Thomas le Latoner’ or
‘Richard le Latoner’ would be well understood by
our forefathers.</p>

<p class='c007'>But we must not wander. In nothing does our
nomenclature bequeath us a more significant record
than in that which relates to the isolation of primitive
life. We who live in such remarkable days of locomotive
appliance cannot possibly enter into the difficulties
our forefathers had to encounter in regard to
intercommunication. An all but impassable barrier
separated our villages from the larger and distant
towns. The roads, or rather, not to dignify them by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>such a term, the tracks,<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c009'><sup>[277]</sup></a> were sometimes scarce
to be recognised, everywhere rough and dangerous.
Streams, oftentimes much swollen, must be forded.
Where bridges existed our ‘Bridgers’ and ‘Bridgemans’
took the king’s levy; where none were to be
found our ‘Ferrimans’ rendered their necessary aid.
The consequent difficulties with regard to conveyance
were great. The larger of the county towns carried
on but an uncertain and irregular communication,
while the remoter villages were wholly dependent
either on the travelling trader or peddler, or on the
great fair, as it came round in its annual course.
What a stock of goods would be laid in by the
bustling wife, and the farmer himself on this latter
occasion! Imagine them starting forth to lay in a
supply for a whole year’s wants. No wonder the
good, sound cob and the stout wagon it drew are
remembered in our surnames. Of the importance of
the former such names as ‘Horsman,’ if it be not
official, and ‘Palfreyman,’ or ‘Palfriman,’ not to
mention ‘Asseman,’ are good witnesses. Such entries
as ‘Agnes le Horsman,’ or ‘Roger le Palefreyour,’
or ‘John le Palfreyman’ are familiar to
every early register. Our ‘Tranters’ and ‘Traunters’
are but relics of the old ‘Traventer,’ he who let out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>posthorses. In process of time, however, he got
numbered among the many itinerant peddlers or
carriers, of whom I shall speak shortly. Bishop Hall,
in one of his Satires, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And had some traunting chapman to his sire,</div>
      <div class='line'>That trafficked both by water and by fire,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Corsers’<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c009'><sup>[278]</sup></a> or ‘Cossers,’ too, little altered from
the former ‘le Corsour,’ represent, as did the obsolete
‘Horsmonger,’ the dealer in horseflesh. Another
branch of this occupation is represented by our ‘Runchemans,’
‘Runcimans,’ or ‘Runchmans.’ They
dealt in hackney-horses, ‘rounce’ or ‘rouncie’ being
the then general term for such. Chaucer’s ‘Shipman’
was mounted upon one—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For aught I wot, he was of Dertemouth,</div>
      <div class='line'>He rode upon a rouncie, as he couthe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It was, however, a term applied in common to all
manner of horses, and it is quite possible the names
given above must be classed simply with ‘Horseman’
and such like. Brunne, in describing Arthur’s Coronation,
mentions among other his gifts—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Good palfreys he gave to clerks</div>
      <div class='line'>Bows and arrows he gave archers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Runces good unto squiers.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c009'><sup>[279]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>In such grand-looking entries as ‘William le
Charreter,’ or ‘John le Caretter,’ or ‘Andrew le
Chareter,’<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c009'><sup>[280]</sup></a> we should now scarce recognise the humble
‘Carter,’ but so is he commonly set down in the thirteenth
century, our ‘cart’ itself being nothing more
than the old Norman-French ‘charette,’ so familiarized
to us by our present Bible version as ‘chariot.’ This
in the edition of 1611 even was spelt after the old
fashion as ‘charet.’ Our ‘Charters’ are evidently
but relics of the fuller form, a ‘John le Charter’ appearing
in the Parliamentary Writs.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c009'><sup>[281]</sup></a> ‘Char,’ the
root of ‘charet,’ still remains with us as ‘car.’ In
‘Cursor Mundi’ it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nay, sir, but ye must to him fare,</div>
      <div class='line'>He hath sent after thee his chare.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Gower, too, has the word—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With that she looked and was war,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doun fro’ the sky ther cam a char,</div>
      <div class='line'>The which dragons aboute drew.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This was used by people of rank as a fashionable
vehicle for purposes of pleasure; oftentimes, too, by
ladies.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c009'><sup>[282]</sup></a> Corresponding with the other, the driver of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>such was ‘John le Charer’ or ‘Richard le Charrer,’
the present existing forms in our directories being
‘Charman’ and ‘Carman.’<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c009'><sup>[283]</sup></a> ‘Cartman,’ I need not
add, is also found as well as ‘Carter.’ All these
terms, however, are from the Norman vocabulary.
The Saxon word in general use was ‘wagon’ or
‘wain,’ the conductor of which now dwells in our
midst as ‘Wagoner’ or ‘Wagner,’ and ‘Wainman’
or ‘Wenman.’ ‘Charles Wain’ or the ‘Churls Wain’
is the name that constellation still bears, and which
has clung to it, in spite of the Norman, since the day,
a thousand years and more, that the Saxon so likened
it. As in the case of so many other double words
representative of our twofold language, these two
separate terms have come now to denote their own
specialty of vehicle, and it is even possible that so
early as the day in which ‘le Wainwright’ and ‘le
Cartwright’ took their rise this distinction had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>already begun to exist. It is thus our English language
has become so rich, this sheep-and-mutton
redundancy of which Walter Scott in his ‘Ivanhoe’
has so well reminded us. ‘Richard le Drivere’ or
‘John le Drivere’ of course must be placed here, not
to mention an ‘Alice le Driveress,’ who figures in the
Hundred Rolls.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of such consequence was it that the horse-gear
should be carefully put together that it occupied the
full attention of several different artisans. Such
names as ‘Benedict le Sporier,’ or ‘Alan le Lorymer,’
or ‘Nicholas le Lorimer,’ are found in every considerable
roll of the period, and they still exist. The one
of course looked to the rowel, the other to the bit.
‘John le Sadeler’ needs little explanation, his posterity
being still alive to speak in his behalf. The
old Norman-introduced word for a saddle was ‘sell,’
and that it lingered on for a considerable period
is shown by Spenser’s use of it, where he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And turning to that place, in which whyleare</div>
      <div class='line'>He left his loftie steed with golden sell,</div>
      <div class='line'>And goodly gorgeous barbes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Every mediæval roll has its ‘Warin le Seler’ or
‘Thomas le Seller.’<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c009'><sup>[284]</sup></a> The pack-saddle was of such
importance that it required a special manufacturer,
and this it had in our now somewhat rare ‘Fusters’ or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>‘Fewsters.’<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c009'><sup>[285]</sup></a> In his ‘Memorials of London,’ Mr.
Riley mentions a ‘Walter Polyt, fuyster’ (p. xxii.).
A fuster was, strictly speaking, a joiner employed in
the manufacture of the saddle-bow, that is, the wooden
framework of the old saddle. It is derived from the
French ‘fust,’ wood, and that from the late Latin
‘fustis.’ Our ‘Shoosmiths,’ as I have before hinted,
made the horseshoe, while ‘John le Mareshall,’ or
‘Ranulph le Marescal,’ or ‘Osbert le Ferrur,’ or
‘Peter le Ferrour,’ fitted it to the foot. The modern
forms are simple ‘Marshall,’ and ‘Ferrier,’ or ‘Ferrer.’
In the ‘Boke of Curtasye’ it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For eche a hors that ferroure schalle scho,</div>
      <div class='line'>An halpeny on day he takes hym to.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Nothing could be more natural than that the shoeing-forge
should become associated with the doctoring of
horseflesh, but it is somewhat strange that when we
now speak of a farrier we recognise in this old term<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c009'><sup>[286]</sup></a>
simply and only the horse-leech. So full of changes
are the lives of words, as well as places and people.</p>

<p class='c007'>A curious insight into mediæval travel is presented
to our notice in our ‘Ostlers’ and ‘Oastlers’ and
‘Oslers,’ relics of such old registries as ‘Ralph le
Hostiler’ or ‘William le Ostiller.’ This term, once
applied, as it rightly should, to the ‘host’ or ‘hosteller’
himself, has now become confined to the stableman,
thus incidentally reminding us how important this
part of the hostel duties would be at such a time as
I am endeavouring to describe. The idea of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>hosteller being one whose especial office it was to
tend that which was their sole means of locomotion,
thus in time resolved itself into a distinct name for
that branch of his occupation.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c009'><sup>[287]</sup></a> The old ‘Herberjour’
gave lodging, whence it is we get our ‘arbour.’
Our kings and barons in their journeys always kept an
officer so termed, whose duty it was to go before and
prepare and make ready for their coming. Owing to
the large number of household attendants for whom
lodging was required, this was an important and
responsible duty. Thus has arisen our ‘harbinger,’
so often poetically applied to the sun as heralding the
approach of day. The older spelling is preserved in
the ‘Canterbury Tales,’ where it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The fame anon throughout the town is born,</div>
      <div class='line'>How Alla King shal come on pilgrimage,</div>
      <div class='line'>By herbergeours that wenten him beforn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is, however, as applied to lodging-house keepers
our many enrolled ‘Herbert le Herberjurs,’ ‘Roger le
Herberers,’ ‘William le Herbers,’ or ‘Richard le Harebers,’
are met with, and I doubt not our ‘Harbers’
and ‘Harbours’ are their offspring. In this sense the
word is used by our mediæval writers in all its forms,
whether verb, or adjective, or substantive. Tyndale’s
version of Romans xii. 13 is, ‘Be ready to harbour,’
where we now have it ‘given to hospitality.’ Bishop
Coverdale, speaking of the grave, says—‘<i>There</i> is
the harborough of all flesh; there lie the rich and
the poor in one bed’ (<i>Fruitful Lessons</i>). He adds
also, in another place, that Abraham was ‘liberal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>merciful, and harborous’—<i>i.e.</i>, ready to entertain
strangers (<i>The Old Faith</i>). Bradford, too, to give
but one more quotation, prays God may ‘sweep the
houses of our hearts, and make them clean, that they
may be a worthy harborough and lodging for the
Lord’ (<i>Bradford’s Works</i>). Market Harborough
still preserves this old word and its true sense
from being forgotten. With the bearers, therefore, of
the above names we may ally our ‘Inmans’ and
‘Taverners.’ The latter term is frequently found in
early writings, and was evidently in ordinary use for
the occupation—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ryght as of a tavernere</div>
      <div class='line'>The grene busche that hangeth out</div>
      <div class='line'>Is a sygne, it is no dowte,</div>
      <div class='line'>Outward folkys for to telle</div>
      <div class='line'>That within is wyne to selle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>While, however, the tavern has undergone but little
change, the inn has. With our present Bible an inn
is ever a lodging, and this was once the sole idea the
term conveyed. It was not for casual callers by day,
but for lodgers by night. Thus Chaucer in his
‘Knight’s Tale’ uses the verb—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This Theseus, this duk, this worthy knight,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he had brought them into his cite,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ynned them, everich (each) at his degre</div>
      <div class='line'>He festeth them.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Until the fair or wake came on, as I have said, the
community in the more retired nooks and corners of
the country depended entirely on the mounted merchant.
He it was who conveyed to them the gossip
of the time. He it was, or one of his <i>confrères</i>, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>brought them everything which in those days went
under the category of small luxuries. The more
lonely parts of the highway were infested by robbers.
Hence the pack-horsemen and other mounted traders
generally travelled in company, with jingling bell and
belted sword—a warning to evil-minded roadsters.
This was all the more necessary as they but seldom
kept to the main thoroughfare. A straight line
between the adjacent hamlets best describes their
course. Such local terms as ‘Pedlar’s Way,’ or ‘Pedder’s
Way,’ or ‘Copmansford,’ still found in various
parts of the country, are but interesting memorials of
the direct and then lonely route these itinerant traders
took in passing from one village to another. The
number of these roadsters we cannot otherwise speak
of than as that of a small army. Many of them, so
far as our nomenclature is concerned, are now obsolete,
but not a few still survive. Amongst those of a more
general character we find ‘Sellman’ or ‘Selman.’<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c009'><sup>[288]</sup></a>
From the old verb ‘to pad,’ which is still used
colloquially in many districts, for the sober and staid
pace the pack-horsemen preserved, we get our ‘Padmans’
and ‘Pedlers,’ or ‘Pedlars,’ once inscribed as
‘William le Pedeleure’ or ‘Thomas le Pedeler.’ It
is of kin to ‘path.’ We still talk of a ‘footpad,’ who
not more than two centuries ago would also have been
spoken of as a ‘padder.’ So late as 1726 Gay, in one
of his ballads, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Will-a-wisp leads the traveller a-gadding</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Through ditch and through quagmire and bog,</div>
      <div class='line'>No light can e’er set me a-padding</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But the eyes of my sweet Molly Mogg.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Perchance of similar origin, but more probably from
the old ‘ped,’ the basket they carried, are our ‘Pedders,’
‘Peddars,’ and ‘Pedmans.’ ‘Martin le Peddere’
or ‘Hugh le Pedder’ or ‘William Pedman’ was a common
entry at this time. On many parts of the English
coast a fish-basket is still familiarly known as a ‘ped,’
and Mr. Halliwell, I see, quotes from another writer
a statement to the effect that in Norwich, up to a
recent day, or even now, an assemblage whither
women bring their small wares of eggs, chickens, and
other farm produce for sale, is called a ‘ped-market.’
It is likely, therefore, that with these we must ally
‘Godewyn le Hodere’ or ‘John le Hottere,’ who
derived their sobriquets, I doubt not, from the fact of
their carrying their <i>hods</i> or panyers on their backs,
just as masons do now those wooden trays for mortar
which bear the same name.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c009'><sup>[289]</sup></a> Their very titles remind us
that our ‘Huckers,’ ‘Hawkers,’ and ‘Hucksters,’ relics
of the old ‘William le Huckere,’ ‘Simon le Hauckere,’
or ‘Peter le Huckster,’ were from the first good at haggling
and chaffering wherever a bargain was concerned.
Our ‘Kidders,’ the ‘William le Kyderes’ of the fourteenth
century, were of a similar type, whatever their
origin, which is doubtful. Probably, however, we must
refer them to the ‘kid’ or ‘kit,’ the rush-plaited basket
they carried their goods in. We still speak of ‘the whole
kit of them,’ meaning thereby the collective mass of
any set of articles.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c009'><sup>[290]</sup></a> This view is strengthened—we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>might almost say proved—by the fact of a ‘Robert
Butrekyde’ being found in the Hundred Rolls of this
period. This would be a sobriquet given to some one
from the basket he was wont to bear to and from
the country market where he carried on his calling.
Later on we find it used for a large mug or bowl.
In the ‘Farming Book of Henry Best,’ written in
1641, we find it said—‘Some will cutte their cake
and putte (it) into the creame, and this feast is called
the creame-potte or creame-kitte’ (p. 93). The
kidder’s usual <i>confrère</i> was the ‘Badger’—up to the
seventeenth century an ordinary term for one who had
a special licence to purchase corn from farmers at the
provincial markets and fairs, and then dispose of it
again elsewhere without the penalties of engrossing.
It is generally said the sobriquet arose from the
habits of the four-legged animal of that name in
stealing and storing up the grain. The more probable
solution, however, is that it is but a corruption
of ‘baggager,’ from his method of carriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>But we must not forget in our list of early English
strolling merchants that the wandering friars themselves
were oftentimes to be met with bearing treasure
wherewith to tempt the housewife, and no bad bargainers,
if we may accept the statement made against
them by an old political song:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Tinklers’ and ‘Tinkers,’ like our more northern
‘Cairds,’ seem to have been scarcely removed in
degree from the strolling gipsies. They acquired
their name from the plan they adopted of heralding
their coming by striking a kettle, a plan of attracting
attention more euphoniously practised by our bellmen,
with whom we are still familiar. Such names
as ‘Alice Tynkeller’ in the fourteenth century, or
‘Peter le Teneker’ found in the thirteenth century,
show how early had this method been adopted and the
sobriquet given.<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c009'><sup>[292]</sup></a> Last, but not least, come our ‘Chapman’
or ‘Copeman’<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c009'><sup>[293]</sup></a> and ‘Packman.’<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c009'><sup>[294]</sup></a> The former is
sometimes met with as ‘Walter’ or ‘John le Chepman,’
which at once reminds us of his origin, that of the ‘cheap-man,’
or ‘cheap-jack,’ as we should now style him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>The old ‘cheaping,’ or ‘chipping,’ a market-place, still
lingers locally in such place-names as ‘Chipping-Norton,’
or ‘Chipping-Camden,’ or the local surname
‘Chippendale;’ and the verb ‘to chop’—<i>i.e.</i>, to purchase,
I believe, is not yet extinct amongst us. The
once common phrase for selling and exchanging was
‘chopping and changing.’ Coverdale uses it. Speaking
of Christ driving out the money-changers from
the Temple, he says, ‘The Temple was ordained for
general prayer, thanksgiving, and preaching, and not
for chopping and changing, or other such like things’
(<i>The Old Faith</i>). Thus the term ‘chapman’ would
be no unmeaning one to our forefathers. But we
must give him a paragraph to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chapman, you must know, was a great man.
According to more modern usage, he had a fixed
residence, but we may still see him at times, after the
olden fashion, travelling about in a large booth-like
conveyance or rumble. This vehicular mode of
transit set him far above the rank of ordinary footpads.
He was a sort of pedlar in high life, in fact, and
if his position was lofty, his abilities were generally
equal to a performance of its duties. O the sensation
his arrival caused! The village green was instantly
instinct with life. From impossible nooks and crannies
surged forth a small army of all ages. Hoarded
pennies or twopennies were drawn forth from
cherished hiding-places, and flinty maternal pockets
were for the nonce assailed with comparative success.
To the young folks it was the next best thing to Punchinello,
the chapman was so funny. Besides, he had
so many things wherewith to tempt their juvenile
fancy. What was there he had not? Everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>that could under any lax code of fancy possibly or
impossibly come under the all-expansive term of
hardware was crowded within the magic recesses of
that chapman’s van. Dolls and dishes, scissors and
hats, cornplasters and cosmetics, lollipops in the shape
of soldiers, and lollipops in the shape of windmills
issued forth in a succession as insinuating to the
purse as it was tempting to the imagination. And
what a man was Jack himself; he had a joke for everyone,
a frown for none. His face was an ever-changing
picture, bluffed by the wind and burnt by the sun;
still it was ever cheery withal, now demure, half waggish,
half impudent, anon all benevolence as he details
the merits of his latest painless corn-suppressing
plaster, and assures the gaping swains that his sole
object in life, since the happy moment when he first
became acquainted with its virtues, has been to carry
through the world the blissful tidings to suffering man.
All this, he adds, with reckless impudence, has been
done at a great personal pecuniary sacrifice; but an
approving conscience, and the blessings showered
upon his head by the recipients of his generosity, have
been his ample reward. Of course they sell like wildfire,
and the profits are enormous.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c009'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Our ‘Packmans,’ ‘Paxmans,’ and perhaps ‘Packers,’
were, as a rule, the village commissioners.<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c009'><sup>[296]</sup></a> What a
simple and homely state of life do their names suggest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>No half-hourly omnibus, or still more frequent
train, whisked off the bustling housewife to the big
town—now some sleepy old place with grass-grown
streets, and half a century behind the times, where
‘news much older than the ale goes round’—but then
the thrifty emporium of cheese and butter and such
like stores, and great in the eyes of country bumpkins.
No; if you visited the town in those days you must
make a day of it. And the mistress knew better than
do this. Leave her dairy, forsooth—what would become
of the cream if she left Malkin to forget her
work, and talk with Giles the cowboy behind the
stable door all morning? She leave, indeed! Of
course she could not, so there was the pack-horseman,
who for a trifling commission went to and from the
market for her and her neighbours. As he returned
in the cool of the evening, when the sun was low and
work over, you might see him pausing awhile at the
door of the farmsteads, long after he has given the
mistress her store, and, more slily, Malkin her ribbon.
He is in no hurry now, for he is telling the country
folk all the news; how the great world is wagging,
and how there has been a great battle with the
Frenchers some six or eight weeks ago (news, good
or bad, did not travel fast in those days). The
Frenchmen are looked upon by the simple rustics
as the very impersonification of iniquity, they being
under a sort of impression that a Frenchman is a
being who defies God and man alike, and would think
no bones of eating you up. At once the packman is
plied for a full, true, and particular account of the
battle, and he, there being none to gainsay his description,
and with an eye probably to the good wife’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>best ale, which, as he well knows from experience, will
be brought forth with a freedom of hospitality proportionate
to the horror of the details, fills up a bloody
tale with sundry touches of a most tragic character,
while the country folk gape in wide-mouthed terror,
and the old grandmother cries ‘Lord, ha’ mercy on
us!’ His face is lost to sight once more in the ale
jug, and then he passes on to other steads, where a
similar scene and a similar reward await his thirsty
soul. Another name in evident use for the packman
was that of ‘Sumpter,’ ‘Martin le Someter’ or
‘William le Sumeter’ being common entries at this
time. We are still familiar with the term as applied
to the mule or horse that carried the baggage, but in
a personal sense it has long been extinct,<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c009'><sup>[297]</sup></a> saving in
our directories, where as ‘Sumpter’ and ‘Sumter’ it is
by no means seldom met with. How large a load
these animals were required to bear we may picture to
ourselves from a verse found in ‘Percy’s Reliques’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But, for you have not furniture</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Beseeming such a guest,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With that two sumpters were discharged,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In which were hangings brave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Silke coverings, curteins, carpets, plate,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And all such turn should have.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>But useful as were all these various itinerants, it
was at the great yearly wakes or fairs, held in commemoration
of the church dedication, that the housekeepers
round laid in their greatest store. The term
‘wake’ denotes ‘a watching,’ because of the vigil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>observed during the night preceding the festival itself.
Indeed ‘wake’ and ‘watch’ were for centuries synonymous
words.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c009'><sup>[298]</sup></a> Wicklyffe translates Mark xii. 37—‘Forsooth,
that that I say to you, I say to all, Wake
ye.’<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c009'><sup>[299]</sup></a> Thus it is that our ‘Wakemans’ are but memorials
of the old village guardian or night watchman,
while our ‘Wakes’ can boast a title dating so far
back as the time when ‘Hereward the Wake,’ or
Watchful, was fighting the last battle of the down-trodden
and oppressed Saxon.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c009'><sup>[300]</sup></a> These fairs were by
no means for mere pleasure-seekers, as we might imagine
from such a term as ‘church-ale,’ or judging by
the aspect of such festivals in the present day. They
had an end to answer, and an important end, and in
early times they fulfilled it. It was here the farmers
round brought their produce, ready to sell their wool
for good sound money, or to exchange it for commodities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of which they stood in need. It was here the
foreign trader came to purchase sheep-fells and other
skins, soon, by transmission abroad, to be worked up
by Flemish hands into good broadcloth, and retransmitted
again to London or provincial marts.
Edward the Confessor obtained a sum of 70<i>l.</i>, an
immense amount at such a time as this, from the tollage
at a fair held in Bedfordshire. Of many celebrated
fairs, those of Smithfield on St. Bartholomew’s
Day (which still exists as a kind of perpetual one),
York, Winchester, and Ely seem to have been the
most frequented. That in the Isle of Ely was kept
up on and for some days after the feast of St. Awdrey,
or Audrey, the corrupted name of St. Etheldreda,
which as a surname our ‘Awdreys’ still preserve.
This seems to have become specially noted for its sale
of trinkets, toys, and cheap and gay laces—so much
so that in course of time ‘tawdry,’ or St.-Awdry, ware
became the colloquial and general term for such.
Drayton we even find using the word substantively
when he says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Of which the Naiads and blue Nereids make</div>
      <div class='line'>Them tawdries for their neck.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c009'><sup>[301]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Of the still greater one held at Winchester, we find
Piers the Plowman speaking:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To Wye and to Winchester</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I went to the fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>With many manner merchandise,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As my master me hight:</div>
      <div class='line'>But it had been unsold</div>
      <div class='line in2'>These seven years,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>So God me help,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Had there not gone</div>
      <div class='line'>The grace of guile</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Among my chaffer.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The ‘Wife of Bath,’ too, has a word to say upon this
subject. Says she:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I governed them so wel after my lawe,</div>
      <div class='line'>That eche of them ful blissful was and fawe</div>
      <div class='line'>To bringen me gay thinges fro the feyre.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>What a picture does all this present to our eye. We
can see the circular stand of booths belting the rails
of the quaint belfried edifice, sometimes, I am afraid,
the sacred precincts within.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c009'><sup>[302]</sup></a> Behind these we may
note how busy are our ‘le Stallers’ and ‘le Stallmans,’
now found also as ‘Stalman;’ not to say our
‘Stallards,’ that is, stall-wards, and obsolete ‘le Vendours.’
No infliction too severe can be made upon
their readiness to please. Elbowing and chaffering
and good-humoured haggling are the order of the day.
Here the stupid, happy swain, with his be-ribboned
sweetheart tucked under his arm, is buying their little
stock wherewith to start life; here the child is made
blissful with a trumpet, and the hoary-headed rustic
gets a warmer cap for his crown. Here, too, it is that
the chapman and other of his <i>confrères</i>, as I have
already hinted, are buying in their varied commodities.
All alike are well catered for. When we talk
of ‘packing up our duds,’ few of us, I imagine, are
aware that we are using a word of most familiar import
in long generations gone by. A ‘dud’ then was
a coarse, patched linen gown, gaudy in colour, made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>up in fact of variegated pieces of this material. Hence
he who sold such cheap, flashy goods at a fair, any old
fripperer in truth, was styled a ‘dudder’ up to comparatively
recent times, and the booth itself a ‘duddery.’
‘Duderman’ and ‘Dudder’ (now obsolete),
‘Dudman’ and ‘Dodman,’ are all, I doubt not, but
interesting memorials of this once flourishing lower
class trade. Such names as ‘Thomas Dudman’ or
‘Ralph Deuderman’ greet us occasionally in the olden
rolls. ‘William Fairman,’<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c009'><sup>[303]</sup></a> found in the Parliamentary
Writs, would be, I suppose, a more general vendor.
He has not a few descendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while bartering and the purchase and sale
of these varied household commodities occupied no
small amount of attention, such a sober mode of passing
the fairtide was very far from being the intention
of the younger and gayer portion of the assemblage;
nor was there, indeed, any lack of that which could
feed or give zest to their relish for amusement, though
it was not always of the most innocent nature. Our
‘Champions’ and ‘Campions’ are but relics of the old
‘William le Champion,’<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c009'><sup>[304]</sup></a> or ‘Katerine le Chaumpion,’
a sobriquet which would easily affix itself to some
sturdy and swarthy rustic who had thrown his adversary
in the wrestling ground. This has ever been a
popular sport amid our more rural communities. The
Miller, Chaucer says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Was a stout carl for the nones,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ful bigge he was of braun, and eke of bones,</div>
      <div class='line'>That proved wel, for over all ther he came,</div>
      <div class='line'>At wrestling he would bear away the ram.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In an old poem I have already quoted, the mother
warns her daughter:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Go not to the wrestling, nor shooting the cock,</div>
      <div class='line'>As it were a strumpet or a giglot.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c009'><sup>[305]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Doubtless such a sobriquet as ‘Richard le Fytur,’ that
is ‘Fighter,’ would be but representative of the same.
The country folks were not slow, too, to copy their
masters, and in the friendly joust the former, ‘Thomas
le Justere’ or ‘Robert le Justure,’ would brace himself
amid the excited ring to unseat his fellow-swain,
affording much sport to the on-looking wags.</p>
<p class='c007'>By the maypole you may see the conjuror, or
‘Wiseman,’ as he was generally termed, battening
himself upon the superstitious minds of the assembled
hinds. In the Hundred Rolls he figures as ‘Wysman’
and ‘Wyseman.’ A little further on our ‘Players’
would be enacting their mummery. The great crowd
there in the corner are watching the showman with
his dancing bear, a yearly treat the younger holiday-seekers
always appreciated. What a change has
come over our English habits with regard to this
animal. Dancing was the least cruel of the sports
connected with it. Time was when every noble of
position had his bears and his bearward, when even
royalty could boast a master of the king’s bears, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>when as a pastime the bear-baiting took an easy pre-eminence
in the eyes of all holiday folk. A skit on
the Earl of Warwick, banished to the Isle of Man,
written 1399, says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A bereward found a rag:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of this rag he made a bag:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He dude in gode entent.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thorwe the bag the bereward is taken;</div>
      <div class='line'>All his beres have hym forsaken.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus is the berewarde schent.<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c009'><sup>[306]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In one of our earlier rolls I find several names that
bear relation to this familiar sport. Of such are
‘Geoffrey Bearbaste’ and ‘Alexander Bearbait.’
More common to us in the present day, however, are
the descendants of the more simple ‘Berward’
(‘Michael le Berward,’ H.R.) and ‘Bearman,’ or
‘Berman’ (‘Ralph Bareman,’ H.R.). In ‘Cocke
Lorelle’s Bote’ mention is made of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Jenkyne Berwarde of Barwyche.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Whether ‘Jenkyne’ was a mythic personage, or
whether any of our present ‘Berwards’ are his lineal
issue, I cannot pretend to say.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c009'><sup>[307]</sup></a> Any way, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>the name would be common enough then. Bull as
well as bear baiting, I need not say, was a popular
pastime with our forefathers. We still talk of bulldogs.
Probably our ‘Bullards’ could formerly have
told us something about this. Fit rival to these latter,
you may see the ‘Cockman,’ or, as he was more generally
termed, the ‘Cocker,’ matching his birds in the
adjacent pit. The author of the ‘Townley Mysteries’
does not give the cocker a good character—at least
he places him in very bad company—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>These dysars, and these hullars,</div>
      <div class='line'>These cokkers, and these bullars,</div>
      <div class='line'>And alle purse cuttars,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Be welle ware of these men.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Among other instances the Hundred Rolls furnish us
with ‘Simon le Cockere’ and ‘William le Koker.’</p>
<p class='c007'>Professional dancers, I need scarcely say, were
seldom absent from the mediæval festival. Tripping
it lightly to some Moorish round, we may see such
folk as ‘Harvey le Danser’ or ‘Geoffrey le Hoppere,’
inciting the younger villagers to follow their
example. The latter name, which occurs frequently
at this time, reminds us that our modern slang term
‘hop’ has but restored the ancient use of this word.
Our Prayer-Book version of the Psalms still employs
the verb in the verse, ‘Why hop ye so, ye high
hills?’<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c009'><sup>[308]</sup></a>—and Chaucer, in picturing the merry ’prentice,
says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>At every bridale would he sing and hoppe;</div>
      <div class='line'>He loved bet the taverne than the shoppe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>The feminine ‘hoppestere,’ which he also uses, does
not sound quite so euphonious. In the ‘Pardoner’s
Tale,’ among other of the dissolute folk in Flanders,
are mentioned ‘tombesteres’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And right anon in comen tombesteres</div>
      <div class='line'>Fetis and smale, and yonge fruitesteres.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>These, I doubt not, were female dancers, and performers
of such bodily gyrations and flexions as
mountebanks are still skilled in. The masculine
form is found in such an entry as ‘William le Tumbere,’
whom we should now, so far as his professional
tricks were concerned, term a tumbler.</p>
<p class='c007'>All this time the mirth of music is at its loudest,
though it is somewhat hard to separate the tones of
the various rival minstrels. There is a trio in one
corner by the tavern door there, discoursing sounds
which are certainly equal, if not superior, to the
Teutonic bands of more modern days. Indeed, with
regard to the latter, I am beginning to suspect the
conjecture of a friend of mine to be perfectly true—that
they are German convicts shipped off, with
cracked and second-hand trumpets, by the Commissioners
of Police to save their keep. It is, however,
right perhaps that the country which sends us the
best should also have the option of sending us the
worst music in the world. The trio we may see here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>at any rate, have one advantage—that of their poetic
mediæval costume. The first we may notice is the
‘Fiddler,’ represented by such men as ‘Robert Fyffudlere,’
or ‘John le Fythelere,’ or the Latinized
‘Rulard Vidulator.’ This last reminds us that it is
now also written ‘Vidler.’ He of course played on
the violin, for I must not say ‘fiddle,’ it is far too
Saxon, for modern cultivated days. The Clerk of
Oxenforde seems to have been superior to the
generality of later university men, for he had—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Liefer have at his beddes head</div>
      <div class='line'>A twenty bokes, clothed in black or red,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Aristotle and his philosophie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than robes riche, or fidel, or sautrie.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Certainly time effects wonderful changes. But I
doubt whether even he would have found much profit,
not to say pleasure, in the study of Aristotle, or any
other philosopher, had he been subjected to the daily
practice of a well-scraped viol in an adjacent dormitory,<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c009'><sup>[309]</sup></a>
the author of which could boast but one tune in
his repertoire, and was determined that every one
should know it. After the Fiddler—Saxon or no
Saxon, I’ll stick to it for the nonce—comes the ‘Piper’
with his reedy stop, and next to him the ‘Taborer’
beating his drum with such rare effect as to make him
the very idol of the youngsters. Spenser calls him
the ‘tabrere,’ which form, as well as ‘Tabrar,’ Tabberer,’
‘Tabor,’ and ‘Taber,’ still exists in our
nomenclature.</p>

<p class='c017'>is the order of the gentle author of the ‘Faerie Queen;’
so having disposed of the two former, the ‘Crowder’
with his six-stringed viol duly engages our attention
next, though he ought more correctly to have been
yoked with the ‘Fiddler.’ ‘Crouth’ was but another
form of the same word. An old Saxon Psalter thus
renders Psalm cl. 4—</p>

<p class='c017'>Wicklyffe, too, translates Luke xv. 25 as follows:—‘But
his eldre sone was in the feeld, and whaune he
cam and neighede to the hous he herde a symfonye
and a crowde.’<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c009'><sup>[310]</sup></a> Like our ‘Harpers’ and more
northern ‘Bairds,’ the ‘Crowder’ or ‘Crowther’ (for
as surnames both forms exist) was oftentimes blind,
and thus gained the ear of an audience, if not appreciative,
at least sympathetic. Seldom, indeed, did he
leave cottage, or hall festival, or fair, without a
guerdon, and a kind word to boot; for while customs
fade out and die, pity, thank God, knows neither
change of season nor chance of time. Mediæval forms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>of the above may be found in ‘Richard le Cruder’ or
‘Thomas le Crowder.’ But we have yet several more
surnames to mention which prove the once great popularity
of this latter class of instrument. ‘German le
Lutrere’ and ‘John le Leuter’ have left no descendants,
I think.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c009'><sup>[311]</sup></a> The more common term was lutanist,
but of this I have found no instance. While the
lute had generally ten strings, and was struck by the
hand, the viele or viol had six, was of stronger make,
and was played with a bow. It seems to have been a
favourite instrument in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, for such registrations as ‘Benedict le Viler,’
‘Nicholas le Vylour,’ ‘Wyot le Vilur,’ or ‘Jacob le
Vielur,’ occur with tolerable frequency at that period.
Another Norman-introduced word was that of ‘gigue,’
or ‘gig.’ This, however, seems to have differed from
the others in being of the very roughest manufacture,
and made specially for professional dancers. These
‘giguers’ were extremely popular at rural festivals of
any kind. At one and the same instant they would
be tripping it round on the ‘light fantastic toe,’
singing some not too select verses, accompanying
themselves on their sturdy instrument, and yet would
have a hand to spare for a trifle if you should offer it.
If you doubted it you had but to try them. It is
thus we have got our ‘jig,’ our ‘gigot,’ or leg of
mutton, too, being so called from its resemblance
thereto. The surnominal form is found in such
entries as ‘Walter le Gigur,’ or ‘Alexander le Gygur,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>but I doubt whether either is represented now. The
last of this class of instrumentalists we may mention
is ‘William le Sautreour,’ he who struck the ‘gay
sawtrye,’ as Chaucer terms it. The more correct
form of the word was ‘psaltery.’ It was specially
used as an accompaniment for the voice, hence it is
freely used in this sense in the Authorized Version.
I do not doubt myself that some of our ‘Salters’ are
but a change rung on the mediæval ‘Sawtrer.’ The
‘Fluter,’ I believe, has left no descendants, but in
‘Nicholas le Floutere’ he was to be met with at this
date, and, I need not say, would be as familiar as he
would be acceptable on such an occasion as this. The
lusty young Squire was so musical that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Singing he was, or floyting alle the day,</div>
      <div class='line'>He was as freshe as is the month of May.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>There is one name I must mention here, that of
‘Peter le Organer,’<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c009'><sup>[312]</sup></a> perhaps connected with ‘Orger’
of the same date. The owner of this more modern-looking
term may either have been organist at some
monastery or abbey-church, or he may have played
upon the portable regal, in which latter case he too
might possibly have been seen here. But ‘organ’
was a very general term. In the old psalters it seems
to have been used for nearly every species of instrument.
We should scarcely speak now of ‘hanging
up our “organs” upon the willows,’ but so an old version
of the Psalms has it. Did we not know they
were a modern invention we might have been inclined
to suspect ‘le Organer’ to have been but a strolling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>performer upon the ‘hurdy-gurdy.’ That, however,
was an infliction mercifully spared to our forefathers.
In concluding this brief survey of mediæval music,
I cannot, I think, do better than quote, as I have
done partially once before, Robert de Brunne’s
account of the coronation of King Arthur, wherein
we shall find many, if not most, of the professional
characters I have been mentioning familiarly spoken
of. He says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Jogelours weren there enow</div>
      <div class='line'>That their quaintise forthe drew:</div>
      <div class='line'>Minstrels many with divers glew (glee)</div>
      <div class='line'>Sounds of bemes (trumps) that men blew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Harpes, pipes, and tabours,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fithols (fiddles), citolles (cymbals), sautreours,</div>
      <div class='line'>Belles, chimès and synfan</div>
      <div class='line'>Other enow and some I cannot name.</div>
      <div class='line'>Songsters that merry sung,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sound of glee over all rung;</div>
      <div class='line'>Disours enow telled fables:</div>
      <div class='line'>And some played with dice at tables.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>But we are not without traces of the troubadour.
The simple vocalist, a strolling professionalist, too, in
many instances, remains hale and hearty in our
‘Glemans,’ ‘Gleemans,’ and ‘Glemmans,’ not to
mention our ‘Sangsters.’ Amid such lulls as might
intervene, we should hear them at the popular festivals
bidding for favour with their old-fashioned stories
of ‘hawk and hound,’ and ‘my ladyes bower,’ set,
no doubt, to airs equally <i>à la mode</i>. A contemporary
poet tells us their song</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hath been sung at festivals</div>
      <div class='line'>On ember eves, and holy-ales.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The recitation of these stories seems to have been a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>peculiarly popular profession. Our ‘Rhymers’ oftentimes
showed their skill in the art of rhythmical
narration by weaving the exploits they described into
extempore verse.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c009'><sup>[313]</sup></a> The ‘Juggler’ or ‘Joculator,’
originally a minstrel or ‘jester,’ something akin to the
clown of later days, became by-and-by more celebrated
for his skill in legerdemain than loquacity, and
now little else is understood by the word. Almost
every baron, and even the king himself, had his favourite
jester; but it was an art put to the most corrupt
purposes, and ‘Jagge the Jogelour’ is set in very
low company by Piers Plowman. Certainly his jokes
were of the lewdest description, even for the rough
times in which he lived. His voice, too, was sufficiently
elevated, if we may trust the account given in the
‘Romance of Alexander,’ for—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No scholde mon have herd the thondur,</div>
      <div class='line'>For the noise of the taboures,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the trumpours, and the jangelours.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The ‘Dissour,’ the old Norman ‘diseur,’ similar in
character to the rhymer and the juggler, seems to have
left no memorial, saving it be in our ‘Dissers;’<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c009'><sup>[314]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>neither can I trace ‘le Tregetour’ later than the
fifteenth century. Every footprint of his professional
existence, indeed, is now faded from our view. And
yet there was the day when none could be more
familiar than he. The Hundred Rolls record not
merely ‘Symon le Tregetor,’ but ‘William le
Tregetur’ also, while ‘Maister John Rykele’ is
spoken of by Lydgate as ‘sometime Tregitour of
noble Henrie, King of Engleland.’ Chaucer, too,
mentions sciences</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By which men maken divers apparences,</div>

      <div class='line'>Under a walnut-shell;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>with other equally marvellous feats. Thus we see
that the art of legerdemain was not neglected at this
time.</p>
<p class='c007'>I doubt whether any relics we possess so completely
convey to our minds the radical changes which
have swept across the face of our English Commonwealth
as do these lingering surnames. They remind
us of the invention of printing, of the spread of literature,
and of the slow decay thereby of the professions
they represented. They tell us of a changed society,
they tell us of a day of rougher cast and looser trammels;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>they tell us of a life around which the lapse of
intervening years has thrown a halo of so quaint
aspect that we all but long, in our more sentimental
moods, to be thrown back upon it again. Placing
these tell-tale names by the life of the present, we
see what a change has passed over all. Let us hope
this change denotes progress. In some respects it
assuredly does: progress in the settlement of our
common rights and duties, progress in civilization
and order, progress in mental culture, progress in
decorum. Still we may yet ask, with all this has
there been any true progress? The juggler, ’tis true,
with his licentious story, and the dissolute tragetour,
both are gone—they would be handcuffed now, and
put in gaol. This speaks something for a higher cultivation.
But, after all, may not this be a mere outside
refinement—a refinement to meet the requirements of
an age in which the head is educated more than the
heart—a refinement which may be had in our shops—the
refinement, in fact, of the lowest of God’s
endowed creatures, that of the exquisite? This is,
indeed, an artificial age, and it warns us to see to it
whether we are hypocrites or no; whether our life is
entirely external or the reverse; whether it is all shell
and no kernel, all the outside cup and platter, and
within naught save extortion and excess. That
mortal shall have attained the highest wisdom who,
in the light of the world to come, shall have seen to
the cleansing of that which is within, and if that, if
the heart be cleansed, then the external life will as
naturally, as it will of necessity, be pure.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SURNAMES OF OCCUPATION. (TOWN).</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>We have already said enough to show that our early
English pursuits were mainly pastoral. Even to this
day, as we are whisked across the midland counties
or driven across the Yorkshire wolds, we see what
advantages we must have enjoyed in this respect.
Our one chief staple was wool, and to export this in a
raw unmanufactured state was the early practice. So
general was this occupation that even subsidies to the
crown were given in wool. In 1340, 30,000 sacks of
wool were granted to Edward III. while engaged in
the French War. This would be a most valuable
contribution, for at this time it was held in the highest
repute by foreign buyers. ‘The ribs of all nations
throughout the world,’ wrote Matthew Paris, ‘are
kept warm by the fleeces of English wool’ (Smiles).
So early as 1056 we find the Count of Cleves obtaining
a certain jurisdiction over the burghers of Nimeguen
upon condition of presenting to the Emperor
every year ‘three pieces of scarlet cloth of English
wool’ (Macullum). With the incoming of the Flemish
refugees and other settlers already mentioned this
state of things was changed. The Conqueror himself
had settled one band near Carlisle, but his son Henry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>soon after coming into possession removed them into
Herefordshire, and the Southern Marches of the Principality.
Doubtless the object of both was that of
setting up a barrier against hostile encroachments on
the part of the Scotch and Welsh; but the result was
the spread of a peaceful and useful industry in two
widely separated districts. Two other settlements, in
Norfolk and Suffolk, one by Henry I., the other
under the direction of Edward III., made East
Anglia for centuries the Yorkshire of England.
When we talk so familiarly of ‘worsted,’ or ‘lindsey-wolsey,’
or ‘kerseymere,’ or ‘bocking,’ we are but
insensibly upholding a reputation which centuries
ago the several villages that went by these names had
obtained through Flemish aid. Thus was it then that
at length our country was enabled to produce a cloth
which could afford a comparison with that of the
Flemish cities themselves. Of this incoming many
surnames of this date remind us, the most important
of which I have already mentioned in my chapter
upon local names, ‘Fleming,’ as a general name for
all these settlers, being the commonest.</p>
<p class='c007'>When, however, we turn to the occupations themselves
connected with the industry, we cannot but be
struck by the wonderful impress it has made upon our
nomenclature. The child’s ancient rhyme—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Black sheep, black sheep,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Have you any wool?</div>
      <div class='line'>Yes, sir; yes, sir;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Three bags full—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>carries us to the first stage, and to the first dealer.
In our ‘Woolers’ and ‘Woolmans,’ in our obsolete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>‘Woolmongers’ and ‘Woolbuyers,’<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c009'><sup>[315]</sup></a> in our ‘Packers’<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c009'><sup>[316]</sup></a>
and once flourishing ‘Woolpackers,’ and in our ‘Lanyers’
and ‘Laners,’ relics of the old and more Norman
‘Bartholomew le Laner’ or ‘John le Lanier,’ we can
see once more the train of laden mules bearing their
fleecy treasure to the larger towns or distant coast.
No wonder that Piers Plowman and others should
make familiar mention of the ‘pack-needle,’ when we
reflect upon the enormous number of sacks that would
be in constant use for this purpose; and no wonder
‘Adam le Sakkere’ (<i>i.e.</i> ‘Sacker’), and ‘Henry le Canevaser’
are to be met with as busied in their provision.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c009'><sup>[317]</sup></a>
Another proof of the engrossing importance of this one
English article of commerce is left us in our ‘Staplers.’
The ‘stapleware’ of a town was, and is still, that
which is the chief commodity dealt in by that particular
market. A ‘stapler,’ however, has for centuries
been a generally accepted title for a woolmerchant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>and has therefore absorbed the more
general meaning the word ought to have conveyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first stage towards manufacture would be the
process of carding the raw and tangled material, and
numberless are the ‘Carders,’ ‘Combers,’ and ‘Kempsters,’<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c009'><sup>[318]</sup></a>
or ‘Kemsters,’ who remind us of this. In these
latter sobriquets we have but varied forms of the
same root ‘cemb,’ to comb. We still talk poetically
of ‘unkempt locks,’ and we are told of Emelie in the
‘Knight’s Tale’ that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Her bright hair kembed was, untressed all.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The Norman corresponding name is found in ‘Robert
le Peinnur’ or ‘William le Puigneur,’ but unless in
our ‘Pinners’ (a supposition not unnatural) it has left
no descendants. But even these are not all. It is
with them we must associate our ‘Towzers’ and
‘Tozers,’ from the old ‘touse’ allied to ‘tease’—they
who cleared the fibre from all entanglements. Spenser
talks of curs ‘tousing’ the poor bear at the baiting,
and I need not remind the reader that in our somewhat
limited canine nomenclature, ‘Towzer,’ as a
name for a dog of more pugnacious propensities,
occupies a by no means mean place. As applicable
to the trade in question, Gower uses the word when
he says, in his ‘Confessio Amantis’:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What schepe that is full of wulle</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon his backe they tose and pulle.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c009'><sup>[319]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>It is here, therefore, we must place our one or two
solitary relics of the rough machinery then in use. In
‘Cardmaker’ we have the manufacturer of the ‘comb’
or ‘card’ thus usefully employed; in ‘Spindler’
the maker of the pin round which the thread was
wound; while our ‘Slaymakers,’<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c009'><sup>[320]</sup></a> ‘Slaymans,’ and
obsolete ‘Slaywrights’<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c009'><sup>[321]</sup></a> preserve the once so familiar
‘slay’—that moveable part of the loom which the
webbe with his fingers plied nimbly and deftly along
the threads. A petition to Parliament in 1467 from
the worsted manufacturers complains that in the
county of Norfolk there are ‘divers persones that
make untrue ware of all manner of worstedes, not
being of the assises in length nor brede, nor of good,
true stuffe and makyng, and the <i>slayes</i> and yern
thereto belonging untruly made and wrought, etc.’
(Rot. Parl. Ed. IV.) I believe the word is not yet
obsolete as a term of the craft.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have mentioned ‘Webbe.’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My wife was a webbe</div>
      <div class='line'>And woolen cloth made,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>says Piers in his ‘Vision.’ This appears, judging at
least from our directories, to have been the more
general term, and after it its longer forms, the masculine
‘Webber’ and the originally feminine ‘Webster.’
A poem written in the beginning of the sixteenth
century refers to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>Curriers, cordwayners, and cobelers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gyrdelers, forborers, and webbers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Such entries as ‘Elyas le Webbe,’ or ‘Clarice le
Webbere,’ or ‘John le Webestre,’ are of common
occurrence in our mediæval and still earlier records.
But the processes are anything but at an end. The
cloth must be dyed and fulled. Of the first our
‘Listers,’ once enrolled as ‘Hugh le Litster’ or
‘Henry le Littester,’<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c009'><sup>[322]</sup></a> speak, and ‘Dyer’ or ‘Dister,’
still harder of recognition in such a guise as ‘Geoffrey
le Deghere’ or ‘Robert le Dighestere,’ forms
found at the period we are writing about. It was John
Littester, a dyer, who in 1381 headed the rebellion in
Norwich. Here the surname was evidently taken
from the occupation followed. Halliwell gives the
obsolete verb ‘to lit’ or dye, and quotes an old manuscript
in which the following sentence occurs: ‘We
use na clathis that are littede of dyverse coloures.’
Such names as ‘Gilbert le Teinturer,’ or ‘Richard le
Teynterer,’ or ‘Philip le Tentier,’ which I have come
across in three separate records, represent the old
French title for the same occupation, but I believe
they have failed to come down to us—at least I have
not met with any after instance. The old English
forms of ‘tincture’ and ‘tint’ are generally found to
be ‘teinture’ and ‘teint.’ The teinturer is not without
relics. We still speak when harassed of ‘being on the
<i>stretch</i>,’ or when in a state of suspense of ‘being upon
<i>tenter</i>-hooks,’ both of which proverbial expressions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>must have arisen in the common converse of cloth-workers.
The tenter itself was the stretcher upon
which the cloth was laid while in the dyer’s hands.
On account of various deceits that had become
notorious in the craft, such, for instance, as the over-stretching
of the material, a law was passed in the first
year of Richard III. that ‘tentering’ or ‘teyntering’
should only be done in an open place, and for this
purpose public tenters were to be set up. (‘Stat.
Realm,’ Rich. III.) We find many references to this
important instrument in old testaments. Thus an
inventory of goods, dated 1562, belonging to a man
resident in the parish of Kendall, speaks of ‘Tenture
posts and woodde, 6<i>d.</i>—ii tentures 20<i>s.</i>’ (‘Richmondshire
Wills,’ p. 156.) The dyes themselves used in
the process of colouring are not without existing
memorials. In the York Pageant, already referred to,
we find, walking in procession with the woolpackers,
the ‘Wadmen,’ that is, the sellers of woad, unless
indeed, they were the dyers themselves. The more
common spelling was ‘wode,’ and when not local,
‘Thomas le Wodere’ or ‘Alan le Wodeman,’ with
their modern ‘Wooder’ and ‘Woodman,’ will be
found, I doubt not, to be the representative of this
calling. ‘John Maderman,’ and ‘Lawrence Maderer’
remind us of the more reddish and popular hues.
Great quantities of this were yearly imported from
Holland, especially Middleburgh. The old ‘Libel on
English Policy’ speaks of—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>The thickening mill, however, has left us several words
of much more familiar import than these—viz.,
‘Tucker,’ ‘Fuller,’ (or ‘Fulman’<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c009'><sup>[323]</sup></a>) and ‘Walker.’<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c009'><sup>[324]</sup></a>
Among other older forms we find ‘Roger le Tukere,’
‘Percival le Toukare,’ ‘Walter le Fullere,’ ‘Ralph le
Walkere,’ and ‘Peter le Walkar.’ Of the first Piers
in his ‘Vision’ makes mention, where he speaks of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wollene websteris,</div>
      <div class='line'>And weveris of lynen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Taillours, tanneris,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Tokkeris bothe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Cocke Lorelle’ also refers to—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Multiplyers and clothe thyckers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Called fullers everychone.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Walker,’ claiming as it does an almost unrivalled
position in the rolls of our nomenclature, reminds us
of the early fashion of treading out the cloth before
the adaptations of machinery were brought to bear on
this phase of the craft. In Wicklyffe’s version of the
story of Christ’s transfiguration he speaks of his clothes
shining so as no ‘fullere or walkere of cloth’ may
make white upon earth.<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c009'><sup>[325]</sup></a> Reference is made to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>same practice by Langland also when, using this whole
process of cloth-making as an illustration, he says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Cloth that cometh fro the wevyng</div>
      <div class='line'>Is nought comely to wear</div>
      <div class='line'>Til it be fulled <i>under foot</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or in fullying stokkes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Washen wel with water,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with taseles cracched</div>
      <div class='line'>Y-touked, and y-teynted,</div>
      <div class='line'>And under taillours hande.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We are here not merely furnished with the entire
process itself, but the terms themselves employed
harmonize well with the names I have mentioned.
‘Walker’ and ‘Tucker’ or ‘Towkare’ or ‘Toker,’ as it
was variously spelt, together with ‘Tuckerman,’ have,
however, disappeared as terms of this trade; and it is in
our directories alone we can find them declaring these
forgotten mysteries of a more uncouth manufacture.</p>
<p class='c007'>The ‘taseles’ mentioned in the poem quoted
above were the common ‘teasel’ or ‘tassel,’ a rough
prickly plant allied to the thistle, which when dried
was used for scratching the cloth, and thus raising a
nap thereupon. Thus in Willsford’s ‘Nature’s Secrets’
it is said, ‘Tezils, or Fuller’s Thistle, being gathered
or hanged up in the house, where the air may come
freely to it, upon the alteration of cold and windy
weather will grow smoother, and against rain will close
up his prickles.’ (Brand’s ‘Pop. Ant.,’ vol. iii. p. 133.)
In an inventory of the property of Edward Kyrkelands,
of Kendall, dated 1578, we find the following articles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>mentioned:—iiii syckles, a pair wyes and iii stafs,
tazills, 5<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>—more in tazills, 2<i>s.</i>—iiii tentors, 40<i>s.</i>
(‘Richmondshire Wills,’ p. 274.) The occupation itself
is referred to in an old statute of Edward IV.—‘Item,
that every fuller, from the said feast of St.
Peter, in his craft and occupation of fuller, rower, or
<i>tayseler</i> of cloth, shall exercise and use <i>taysels</i> and no
cards, deceitfully impairing the same cloth’—‘en sa
arte et occupacion de fuller et scalpier ou tezeiler de
drap, exercise et use teizels, &amp;c.’ (4 Ed. IV. c. 1.) It
is probable that our ‘Taylors’ have engrossed this
name. We find it lingering in Westmoreland, about
Kendal, till the middle of the sixteenth century, in
a form which required but little further change to
make it the same. In the will of Walter Strykland,
dated 1568, there is mentioned among other legatees
a certain ‘Edward Taylzer,’ a manifest corruption of
‘Teazeler.’ (‘Richmondshire Wills,’ p. 224.) A century
earlier than this, however, such names as ‘Gilbert
le Tasseler’ or ‘Matilda le Tasselere’ were entered in
our more formal registers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our ‘Baters’ and ‘Beaters,’ relics of the old
‘Avery le Batour’ or ‘John Betere,’ were all but invariably
cloth-beaters, although, like the fuller ‘wollebeter,’<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c009'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
they may have been busied at an earlier stage
of the manufacture. Capgrave, in his ‘Chronicles,’
under date 30 <span class='small'>A.D.</span>, says, ‘Jacobus, the son of Joseph
first bishop of Jerusalem, was throwe there fro the
pinacle of the temple and after smet with a fuller’s
bat.’<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c009'><sup>[327]</sup></a> With the mention of our ‘Shearers’ (‘Richard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>le Sherere,’ M.) and endless ‘Shearmans,’ ‘Sharmans,’
or ‘Shermans’ (‘Robert le Sherman,’ ‘John le Shereman,’
M.), who represent the shearing of the manufactured
fabric, rather than that of the sheep itself, we
have the process complete. The cloth is at length
ready to be transmitted into the care of our ‘Drapers’
and ‘Clothiers,’ and from them again through the
skilled and nimble fingers of our numberless ‘Tailors.’
From all this we may readily see what an important
influence has England’s one great staple of earlier
days had upon the nomenclature of our countrymen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a name as ‘Ralph le Flexman,’ with its many
descendants, reminds us of the manufacture of linen,
which, if not so popular as that of wool, was nevertheless
anything but unfamiliar to the early craftsman.
Our ‘Spinners’ carry us to the primary task of thread-making,
an employment, however, all but entirely in
the hands of the women. The distaff and the weaker
sex have been ever associated, whether in sacred or
profane narrative. Thus it is that ‘spinster’ has
become stereotyped even as a legal term. Chaucer,
four hundred years ago, somewhat uncourteously
said:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Deceite, weping, spinning, God hath given</div>
      <div class='line'>To women kindly, while that they may liven.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Our modern ‘linen’ is formed from ‘lin’ or ‘line’—flax—as
‘woolen’ is from ‘wool.’ Hence we still
speak of the seed of that plant as ‘linseed.’ That
this was the common form of the word we might prove
by many quotations.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He drank never cidre nor wyn</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor never wered cloth of lyn,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>says an old poem. Even Spenser speaks of ‘garment
of line,’ and in ‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote’ allusion is made
to ‘lyne-webbers’ and ‘lyne-drapers.’<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c009'><sup>[328]</sup></a> We need not
be surprised, therefore, to meet with such names as
‘Elias Lyndraper,’ or ‘Henry le Lindraper,’ or ‘John
le Lyner.’ Only this last, however, has survived the
changes of intervening centuries, and still holds a precarious
existence as ‘Liner.’ ‘Weaver’ was more common.
A more Norman equivalent is found in such a
sobriquet as ‘John le Teler,’ or ‘Henry le Telere,’ or
‘Ida la Teleress,’ a name which is not necessarily of
modern French refugee origin, as Mr. Lower would
lead us to suppose. Indeed, a special part of the
ladies’ head-dress had early obtained the name of a
‘teler,’ from the fine texture of the linen of which it
was composed.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c009'><sup>[329]</sup></a> It is but too probable that this name
has become lost, like ‘Taylzer,’ in the more common
‘Taylor.’ This process of absorption we shall find to
be not unfrequent. Nor are we without a memorial
of the bleaching of linen. ‘Whiter,’ if not ‘Whitster,’
still lives in our directories. It seems strange that our
‘Blackers’ should denote but the same occupation; but
so it is—they, like our old ‘Walter le Blakesters’ or
‘Richard le Bleckesters,’ being but the harder and more
antique form of our present ‘bleacher.’<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c009'><sup>[330]</sup></a> Our term
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>‘bleak,’ preserving as it does the earlier pronunciation,
is but the same word, being formerly used to denote
pallor, or wanness, or absence of colour. From this,
by a natural change, it came to signify anything
cheerless or desolate. With perfect honesty in this
case, at any rate, we may ‘swear that black is white.’</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to silk, we had but little to do. The
manufacture of this important cloth was barely carried
on in Western Europe during the period of the establishment
of surnames. It was nigh the close of the
fifteenth century before it appeared in France. All
our silks were imported from the East by Venetian
and Genoese merchants. Of the latter an old poem
says, they come—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Into this londe wyth dyverse merchaundysses,</div>
      <div class='line'>In grete karrekis arrayde wythouten lack,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wyth clothes of golde, silke, and pepir black.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Still we find a company of silkwomen settled in London
at an early period. In the records of this city
occur such names as ‘Johanna Taylour, Silkwyfe,’ in
1348, and ‘Agatha Fowere, Silkewoman,’ in 1417.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c009'><sup>[331]</sup></a>
In 1455 a complaint was raised by ‘the women of
the mystery and trade of silk and threadworkers in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>London, that divers Lombards and other foreigners
enriched themselves by ruining the said mystery.’ I
think, however, we shall find that all these were engaged
less in the manufacture of fabrics than of threads
for the embroiderers to use. Thus, as connected
with the throwing or winding of these silken tissues,
we come across such names as ‘Thrower’ and
‘Throwster,’ the former having been further corrupted
into ‘Trower.’<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c009'><sup>[332]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Next to wool, perhaps leather formed the most
important item of early manufacture. We can hardly
now conceive the infinite use to which it was put at
this period. In military dress it had an especial
place, and in the ordinary costume it was far from
being confined to the extremities, as we have it now.
Jerkins, chausses, girdles, pouches, gipsire—all came
under the leather-dresser’s hands. In 1378 we find a
jury, called together to decide upon a case of alleged
bad tanning, to have been composed of ‘saddlers,
pouchmakes, girdlers, botel-makers, tanners, curriers,
and cordwainers.’ Of the more general manufacture
of hides we have numerous relics; indeed, we are at
once introduced into the midst of a throng of tradesmen,
the very list of which proves the then important
character of the article on which they spent their
energies. Such names as ‘Jordan le Tannur,’ or
‘Loretta le Tannur,’ ‘Richard le Skynnere,’ or ‘Hamo
le Skynnere,’ are still numerous both in the tanyard
and the directory, and need little explanation. Our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>‘Curriers’ are also self-evident; but I have not met
with any instance as yet in mediæval times. Our
more rare ‘Fellmongers’ were once occupied more
directly with the larger hides, or <i>fells</i>, as they were
called, of the farmyard stock. Less connected with
them, therefore, than with the others, we may mention
such men as ‘William le Barcur,’ or ‘Nicholas le
Barkere,’ or ‘Robert Barcarius,’ the ancestors of our
modern ‘Barkers,’<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c009'><sup>[333]</sup></a> who, by the very frequency with
which they are met, show how important was the
preparation of bark in the tanners’ yard. In the
conversation between Edward the Fourth and the
Tanner of Tamworth, as given by Percy, it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What craftsman art thou?’ said the king;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘I pray thee telle me trowe,’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘I am a Barker, Sir, by my trade;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now tell me, what art thou?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Such names as ‘John le Tawyere’ or ‘Geoffrey
le Whitetawier’ (now found as ‘Whittear,’ ‘Whittier,’
and ‘Whityer’), not to mention such an entry as
that of ‘Richard le Megucer,’ throw us back upon
the time when the terms these men severally bore as
surnames would be of the most familiar import.
Their owners spent their energies in preparing the
lighter goat and kid skins, which they whitened, and
made ready for the glovers’ use.<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c009'><sup>[334]</sup></a> The verb ‘to taw,’
however, was also used of dressing flax, and we may
have to place ‘Tawyer’ in some instances in this
category.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>And whilst that they did nimbly spin</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The hemp he needs must taw,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>we are told in ‘Robin Goodfellow.’ Our ‘Towers,’
while apparently local, may be in some instances but
a corruption of this same term. So early as the
14th century we find a certain ‘Eustace le Wittowere’
occurring in the Hundred Rolls, and that the simpler
form should similarly be corrupted would be natural
enough.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c009'><sup>[335]</sup></a> Thus we see that leather, too, is not without
its memorials. The more furry skins, as used in
a somewhat more specific form as articles of dress, or
to attach thereto, we will allude to by-and-by. As
we traverse in some semblance of order the more
definite wants and requirements of early social life,
the importance of these several crafts will be more
clearly brought out. We must not forget that there
were the same needs then as now, though of a different
mould. Man in all time has had to be fed, and
clothed, and housed; and if in all these respects he
has in these modern days become more civilized and
polished, it has been the result of a gradual process
by which he has slowly, and not without many a
struggle, thrown off, one by one, this custom and that,
which belonged to a ruder era and a rougher cast of
society. Our surnames of occupation are a wonderful
guide in this respect. A tolerable picture of early
life may be easily set before us by their aid; for in
them are preserved its more definite lineaments, and
all we need is to fill up the shading for ourselves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Forgotten wants, needs now no longer felt, requirements
of which a progressive civilization slowly
slipped the tether, necessities of dress, of habit, of
routine, all, while the reality has long faded from
view, have left their abiding memorial in the nomenclature
of those who directly supplied them. Let
us, however, observe, as in our other chapters, some
kind of order—clothing, food, and general needs, this
seems the proper course of procedure. And yet one
more observation ere we do so. We have already
spoken of the early system of signs as advertising
the character of the articles to be sold. The early
shop was far more prominent as a rule than the
modern one. The counter, instead of being within
the walls of the house, projected forward upon the
pathway, so much so that we can only compare them
to those tables we may often see at night, where
under the lee of the walls costermongers offer shellfish,
or tripe, or coffee to the passers-by. This was
objectionable enough; but it was not all. Each
dealer loudly proclaimed to the wayfarer the merits
of his goods, vying with his neighbour in his endeavours
to attract attention to himself or distract it
from the other, especially if, as was often the case, a
number of traders trafficked in the same class of
merchandise. Others, and their name was legion, had
no shop at all, not even the street table or counter,
but passing up and down with wooden platters or deep
baskets, made the very air discordant with their loudly
reiterated cries of ‘Hot sheep’s feet,’ or ‘Mackerel,’ or
‘Fresh-herring,’<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c009'><sup>[336]</sup></a> or ‘Hot peascods,’ or ‘Coloppes.’ It
is in reference to this we find Langland saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Cokes and their knaves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cryden, ‘Hote pies, hote!</div>
      <div class='line'>Goode gees and grys!</div>
      <div class='line'>Gowe, dyne, gowe!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Lydgate has a still fuller and more detailed description
of this in his ‘London Lackpenny,’ and as it is
tolerably humorous I will quote it somewhat largely,
using Mr. Bowen’s modernization of it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Within this hall neither rich nor yet poor</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Would do for me aught, although I should die:</div>
      <div class='line'>Which seeing, I got me out of the door,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When Flemings began on me for to cry:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Master, what will you copen or buy?</div>
      <div class='line'>Fine felt hats, or spectacles to read?</div>
      <div class='line'>Lay down your silver, and here you may speed.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then into London I did me hie—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of all the land it beareth the prize.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Hot peascods!’ one began to cry;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Strawberries ripe, and cherries in the rise!’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One bade me come near and buy some spice:</div>
      <div class='line'>Pepper and saffron they gan me bede,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, for lack of money, I might not speed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line in2'>‘Here is Paris thread, the finest in the land!’</div>
      <div class='line'>I never was used to such things indeed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, wanting money, I might not speed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then went I forth by London Stone,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And throughout all Candlewick Street:</div>
      <div class='line'>Drapers much cloth me offered anon;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>One cried ‘Mackerel!’ ‘Ryster green!’ another gan me greet.</div>
      <div class='line'>One bade me buy a hood to cover my head:</div>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>But, for lack of money, I could not speed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>If we pass on from shop to shop in a more quiet
and undisturbed fashion than poor ‘London Lackpenny,’
we must not forget that we are, at least so
far, enjoying that which our forefathers could not.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the head-dress, and to begin with
this, we have many memorials. ‘Tire,’ once a familiar
word enough, is still preserved from decay by
our Authorized Version of the Scriptures. Thus, for
example, it is said in Ezekiel, ‘make no mourning
for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee.’<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c009'><sup>[337]</sup></a>
I do not know how comprehensive are the duties
belonging to our present ‘tirewoman’ or lady’s-maid,
but in the day when the tragic story of Jezebel
was first translated, the sense of the word was entirely
confined to the arrangement of her mistress’s ‘tiara,’
which is but another form of the same term. In the
‘Paradise Lost’ it is found as ‘tiar’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Of beaming sunny rays, a golden tiar circled his head.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>When we remember their former size, their horned
and peaked character, and the variety of the material
used, arguing as they do the then importance of the
fact, we need not be surprised at meeting with comparative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>frequency such a surname as ‘Tyrer,’ ‘Tyerman,’
or ‘Tireman.’ It is somewhat hard to say
whether our ‘Coffers’ are relics of the old ‘Coffrer’ or
‘Coifer,’ but as the latter business was all but entirely
in the hands of females, perhaps it will be safer to
refer them to the other. Such names, however, as
‘Emma la Coyfere’ or ‘Dionysia la Coyfere,’ found in
the thirteenth century, may serve to remind us of the
peculiar style of the head-gear which the ladies affected
in these earlier times. The more special occupation
of preparing feathers or plumes has left its mark in our
‘Plumer’ and ‘Plummer,’ memorials of the old ‘Mariot
le Plumer’ or ‘Peter le Plomer.’ The old ‘caul’ or ‘call’
still lives in our ‘Calmans’ and ‘Callers.’ ‘Elias le
Callere’ occurs in the Parliamentary Writs, and
‘Robert le Callerere’ in the ‘Munimenta Gildhallæ.’
Judging from the ‘Wife of Bath’s Tale,’ we should imagine
this also to have been a female head-dress. There
the old witch appeals to the Queen and her court of lady
attendants as to them who wear ‘kercheif or calle’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Let see, which is the proudest of them alle,</div>
      <div class='line'>That weareth on a kercheif or a calle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Another form of the surname is found in ‘Alicia la
Kellere,’ now simple ‘Keller,’ the article itself being
also met with in a similar dress. In the ‘Townley
Mysteries’ a fallen angel is represented as saying that
a girl—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In its several more general uses it has always maintained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>its strict meaning of a covering.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c009'><sup>[338]</sup></a> Hoshea, we
may recollect, speaks figuratively of God’s ‘rending
the caul of Israel’s heart.’ Probably the word is connected
with the ‘cowl’ of other monkish days, and
thus may be associated with our ‘Coulmans’ and
‘Cowlers.’ ‘Richard le Couhelere,’ an entry of the
fifteenth century, may belong to the same group.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c009'><sup>[339]</sup></a> A
once familiar sobriquet for a hood was that of
‘chapelle,’<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c009'><sup>[340]</sup></a> whence our edifice of that name and the
diminutive ‘chaplet.’ The Parliamentary Writs give
us an ‘Edmund le Chapeler;’ the Hundred Rolls
furnish us, among other instances, with a ‘Robert le
Chapeler.’ ‘Theobald le Hatter,’ ‘Robert le Hattare,’
‘Thomas le Capiere,’ ‘Symon le Cappere,’ or ‘John
Capman’ need no explanation. The articles they
sold, whether of beaver, or felt, or mere woollen cloth,
were largely imported from Flanders. Thus it is that
Lydgate, as I have but recently shown, picturing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>streets of London, mentions spots in his progress
therethrough where—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Flemings began on me for to cry,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Master, what will you copen or buy?</div>
      <div class='line'>Fine felt hats, or spectacles to read?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>That many of these wares, however, were of home
manufacture is equally undoubted, and of this we are
reminded by our ‘Blockers,’ representatives of the old
‘Deodatus le Blokkere.’ The ‘block’ was the
wooden mould upon which the hat was shaped and
crowned. In ‘Much Ado About Nothing’ Beatrice
is made to say: ‘He wears his faith but as the
fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next
block.’ The ‘blocker,’ I doubt not, was but a hat-maker;
we still call a stupid man a <i>blockhead</i>. Our
‘Hurrers’ (‘Alan le Hurer,’ H.R., ‘Geoffrey le Hurwere,’
H.R.), once so important as to form a special
company with articles and overseers, as representative
of an old general term, are not so familiar as we
might have expected them. Bonnets, caps, hoods,
hats, all came under their hands. Strictly speaking,
however, a ‘hure’ or ‘howre,’ as Chaucer spells it,
was a shaggy cap of fur, or coarse jagged cloth. In
an old political song of Edward the First’s time it is
said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Furst there sit an old cherle in a blake hure,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all that there sitteth seemeth best sure.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>That the word itself should have dropped from our
vocabulary is to me a mystery.<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c009'><sup>[341]</sup></a> Even in our nomenclature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>the rarity of our ‘Hurers’ and ‘Hurrers’ is to
me inexplicable, bearing as it does no possible proportion
to the former importance of the occupation. But
this, as I have said before, is one of the peculiarities
of personal nomenclature, depending entirely as it
does on the uncertainties of descent. The head, we
see, was not neglected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sale of woollen cloth by our ‘clothiers’ and
‘drapers’ we have already mentioned. The tailor
then, as now, made it up into the garments which the
age required. Few names went through so many
metamorphoses as this. ‘Mainwaring,’ it is said, can
be found in over a hundred and thirty different spellings.
The exact number with regard to ‘Taylor’ I
cannot state, as I have not dared hitherto to encounter
the task of collecting them. The forms recorded in
one register alone give us such varieties as ‘le
Tayllur,’ ‘le Tayllour,’ ‘le Tayller,’ ‘le Taylir,’ ‘le
Taylour,’ ‘le Taylur,’ ‘le Taillur,’ and ‘le Talur.’ We
have also the feminine ‘la Taylurese’ in the same
roll.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c009'><sup>[342]</sup></a> A name obsolete now in a colloquial sense, but
common enough in our directories, is ‘Parminter,’
‘Parmenter,’ or ‘Parmitar,’ a relic of the old Norman-French
‘Parmentier,’ a term a few hundred years ago
familiarly used also for the snip. Among other
mediæval forms are ‘Geoffrey le Parmunter,’ ‘Saher
le Parmentier,’ ‘William le Parmeter,’ and ‘Richard
le Parmuter.’ The Hundred Rolls give us the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>sobriquet in a Latin dress as ‘William Parmuntarius.’<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c009'><sup>[343]</sup></a>
As associated with the tailor, we may here set down
our ‘Sempsters,’ that is, ‘Seamster,’ the once feminine
of ‘Seamer,’ one who seamed or sewed. Mr. Lower
hints that our ‘Seymours’ may in some instances be
a corruption of this latter form, but I must confess I
discover no traces of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sobriquet of ‘William le Burreller’ introduces
us to a cloth of a cheap mixture, brown in colour, of
well-nigh everlasting wear, and worn by all the
poorer classes of society at this period. So universal
was it that they came to be known by the general
term of ‘borel-folk,’ a phrase familiar enough to
deeper students of antiquarian lore. The Franklin
premises his story by saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But, sires, because I am a borel man,</div>
      <div class='line'>At my beginning first I you beseech</div>
      <div class='line'>Have me excused of my rude speech.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Burrells’ are still sufficiently common to preserve
a remembrance of this now decayed branch of
trade. They may derive their name either from the
term ‘borel’ or ‘burel’ pure and simple, or from
‘Burreller,’ and thus represent the trade from which
the other, as a sobriquet, owed its rise. The manufacturer
is referred to by ‘Cocke Lorelle,’ in the line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Borlers, tapestry-work-makers, dyers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Special articles of costume now wholly disused, or
confined or altered in sense, crop out abundantly in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>this class of surnames. At this period a common outdoor
covering for the neck was the wimple, or folded
vail, worn by women. To this day, I need not say, it
is part of the conventual dress. The author I have
just quoted beautifully describes Shame as—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Humble of her port, and made it simple</div>
      <div class='line'>Wearing a vaile, instede of wimple,</div>
      <div class='line'>As nuns done in their abbey.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Of this princess, too, whose careful dress he so particularly
describes, he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Full seemly her wimple pinched was.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The maker of such was, of course, our ‘Wympler.’<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c009'><sup>[344]</sup></a>
Among other ornaments belonging to the princess,
also, is mentioned ‘a pair of beads,’ that is, bracelets
of small coral, worn upon the arm, and in this case
‘gauded with green.’ A ‘Simon Wyld, Bedemaker,’
is found in the London records of this time, and no
doubt ‘Thomas le Perler’ could have told us something
about the same. Beside these, therefore, we
may set our still existing ‘Paternosters,’ relics of the
old ‘Paternostrer,’ who strung the chaplet of beads
for pattering aves. ‘Paternoster Row,’ literally the
‘Paternostrer’s Row’ was some centuries ago the
abode of a group of these, doubtless then busy
artisans. Mr. Riley, in his interesting ‘Memorials of
London,’ records a ‘William le Paternostrer’ as
dwelling thereby.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c009'><sup>[345]</sup></a> It is among such valuables we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>must undoubtedly set pins at this period. Judging
by those which have descended to us, we should best
describe them as ‘skewers.’ So anxious was Absolom
the clerk to please Alison that, according to Chaucer,
he sent her—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Pinnes, methe (mead), and spiced ale.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Whatever her appetite for the latter, there can be
little doubt that the first would be acceptable enough
in a day when these were so valued and costly as to
be oftentimes made objects of bequeathment. Such
entries as ‘Andrew le Pynner’ or ‘Walter le Pinner’
are, of course, common at this time, and their descendants
still flourish in our midst. Our more rare
‘Needlers’ are but relics of such folk as ‘Richard le
Nedlere’ or ‘John le Nedlemakyere.’<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c009'><sup>[346]</sup></a> Piers, in his
Vision, speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tymme the tynkere</div>
      <div class='line'>And tweyne of his ’prentices:</div>
      <div class='line'>Hikke the hakeney-man,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Hugh the nedlere.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Cocke Lorelle’ also mentions—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Pavyers, belle-makers, and brasyers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pynners, nedelers, and glasyers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The Norman form ‘le Agguiler,’ or ‘Auguiler,’ still
lives in our ‘Aguilers’ if not ‘Aguilars.’ A ‘Thomas
le Agguiler’ represented York in the Parliament of
1305. Chaucer uses ‘aguiler’ in the sense of a
needlecase—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A silver needle forth I drew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Out of an aguiler quaint ’ynow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>But if pins and needles were valued more highly then
than they are now, none the less did ‘buttons’ fulfil
their own peculiar and important use. ‘Henry le
Botoners’ or ‘Richard le Botyners’<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c009'><sup>[347]</sup></a> may be found in
most of our records. I do not see, however, that
their descendants have preserved the sobriquet,
unless, after the fashion of several other words in our
vocabulary, they are flourishing secretly among our
‘Butlers,’ and thus helping to swell the already strong
phalanx that surname has mustered. While, however,
all these representatives of so many though kindred
occupations seem to have flourished in their separate
capacities, I do not doubt but that ‘Richard le
Haberdasher’ would have been able to supply most
of the wares they dealt in. His was a common and
lucrative employment in a day when, to judge by the
contents of a shop of this kind as set down in the
London Rolls, he could offer for purchase such a wide
assortment as spurs and shirts, chains and nightcaps,
spectacles and woollen threads, beads and pen-cases,
combs and ink-horns, parchments and whipcords,
gaming-tables and coffins (Riley’s ‘London Memorials,’
p. 422). There seems to be little doubt, however,
that in the first place he dealt simply in the ‘hapertas,’
a kind of coarse, thick cloth much in vogue at this
time, and that it was from this he acquired the name
he bore.<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c009'><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>The now, I fear, obsolete ‘Camiser’ made the
‘camis’ or chemise, or linen underdress—he was the
shirtmaker, in fact. The former spelling lingered on
to Spenser’s time, who writes of a</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Camis light of purple silk.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is with him we must properly associate our
‘Smockers,’ ‘Smookers,’ and anachronistic ‘Smokers,’
who, though their chief memorial remains in the
rustic smockfrock still familiar in our country districts,
were nevertheless chiefly busied with the
‘smok,’ such as the patient Griselda wore. Of one
of his characters Chaucer says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Through her smocke wroughte with silke</div>
      <div class='line'>The flesh was seene as white as milke.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Such phrases as ‘smock-treason,’ ‘smock-loyalty,’
and ‘smock-race,’ and the flower ‘Lady-smock,’<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c009'><sup>[349]</sup></a>
still remind us that the word was once generally
understood of female attire. Of the flower Shakespeare
makes beautiful mention when he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And ladysmocks all silver white,</div>
      <div class='line'>Do paint the meadows with delight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>The word slop is now well-nigh confined to the
nether garments of our youngsters, but though, in
this pluralized sense, it can date back to the time
when the bard of Avon said of one of his personages
that he was—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From the waist downwards all slops,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>still, singularly used, it was in vogue far earlier. A
‘slop’ in Chaucer’s day, and even up to the fifteenth
century, was a kind of frock or overmantle.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c009'><sup>[350]</sup></a> In the
‘Chanon Yemannes’s Tale,’ the host expresses his
surprise that the Chanon, a ‘lord of so high
degree,’ should make so light of his worship and
dignity as to wear garments well-nigh worn out. He
says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His overest sloppe is not worth a mite.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Slopers’ still remind us of this. Our ‘Pilchers,’
relics of ‘Hugh le Pilecher’ or ‘Nicholas le Pilchere,’
are equally interesting. In his proverbs on covetousness
and negligence, the writer I have just instanced
thus speaks—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>After great heat cometh cold,</div>
      <div class='line'>No man cast his pylche away.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>A ‘pilch’ was a large outer tippet made of fur, and
worn in winter. The modern ladies’ ‘pelisse’ is but
another form of the same root. Speaking of furs,
however, we must not forget our ‘Furriers,’ and once
common ‘Pelters’ and ‘Pellipers.’ They were engaged
in the preparation of the more furry coats of
the wilder animals. In the Hundred and other Rolls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>mention is frequently made of such names as
‘Geoffrey le Pelter’ or ‘Reyner le Peleter.’ A ‘pell’
or ‘pelt’ was any undressed skin. The ‘clerk of the
Pells’ used to be the guardian of the rolls of the Exchequer,
which were written upon a coarse parchment
of this kind. As a general term of dress it was once
of the most familiar import. Wicklyffe, in his complaint
to the king, speaks of the poor being compelled
to provide gluttonous priests with ‘fair hors, and jolly
and gay saddles and bridles, ringing by the way, and
himself in costly cloth and pelure.’ An old song
written against the mendicant friars, too, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Some friars beren pelure aboute,</div>
      <div class='line'>For grete ladys and wenches stoute,</div>
      <div class='line'>To reverce with their clothes withoute,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>All after that they are.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Among the many ordinances passed to curtail the
subject’s liberty in regard to his attire, much is
written on the fashion of wearing furs. It seems to
have been the great mark between the higher and
lower classes. In 1337 it was enacted by Edward III.
that no one of those whom we now term the operative
class should wear any fur on his or her dress, the
fur to be forfeited if discovered. The names I have
mentioned above still remain in fair numbers as a
memorial of this period.</p>
<p class='c007'>Such a name from the ‘Rolls of Parliament’ as
that of ‘John Orfroiser,’ although now obsolete,
reminds us of an art for which English craftsmen
obtained a well-nigh European reputation in mediæval
times, that of embroidery. ‘Aurifrigium’ was the
Latin word applied to it, and this more clearly betrays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>the golden tissues of which its workmanship mainly
consisted. In the ‘Romance of the Rose,’ it is said
of the fair maid ‘Idlenesse’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And of fine orfrais had she eke</div>
      <div class='line'>A chapelet, so seemly on,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ne wered never maide upon.<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c009'><sup>[351]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The term ‘Broiderer,’<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c009'><sup>[352]</sup></a> however, was the more common,
and with him all textures and all colours and
all threads came alike. The Hebrew word in our
Bible, variously rendered as ‘broidered work,’ ‘needlework,’
and ‘raiment of needlework,’ was translated
in a day when this would be of the most familiar import.
Our ‘Pointers’ and ‘Poynters’ manufactured
the tagged lace which fastened the hose and doublet
together. In Shakespeare’s ‘1 Henry IV.’ there is a
playful allusion to this where Falstaff, in the act of
saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Their points being broken,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>is interrupted by the response—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Down fell their hose.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It has been asserted that the presence of this name
in our modern directories is entirely the result of later
French refugee immigration; but such registered
forms as ‘John le Poyntour,’ ‘Robert le Poynter,’ or
‘William Poyntmakere’ are found in the records of
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries with sufficient
frequency to justify the belief that it was a much earlier
denizen than many suppose.<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c009'><sup>[353]</sup></a> In the former ‘Henry
le Lacer’ or ‘Richard le Lacer’ we have, too, but a
fellow-manufacturer. Lace, it is true, is now rather a
delicate fabric of interwoven threads; once, however,
it was but the braided string for fastening the
different articles of dress together. Thus, the ‘shoes-<i>latchet</i>’
mentioned in Scripture is a mere diminutive
of the word as thus used. The hose and doublet
were invariably so attached. The verb ‘to lace,’
I need not add, is still entirely employed in this its
literal sense. There were other means, however, of
holding the several garments together, and not a few
of which are still brought to our remembrance in our
nomenclature. ‘Adam le Gurdlere’ or ‘Robert le
Girdlere’ speaks for himself. It was for the girdle
our former ‘Agnes Pouchemakers,’ ‘Henry Pouchers,’
‘Robert le Purseres,’ and ‘Alard le Bursers’ (when
not official) made the leathern pouch carried thus at
her side for greater readiness by the careful housewife.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Chaucer, whose sharply-cut descriptions of the dress of
his company are invaluable to those who would study
more closely the habits of the time, tells us of the
Carpenter’s wife that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>By her girdle hung a purse of leather,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tasseled with silk and pearled with laton.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The Norman equivalent of Girdler was ‘le Ceynturer’
(‘Nicholas le Ceynturer,’ A.) or ‘le Ceinter,’ but I
have failed to find any traces of it beyond the fourteenth
century.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c009'><sup>[354]</sup></a> Our decayed ‘Brailers’<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c009'><sup>[355]</sup></a> and ‘Bregirdlers’
represent but the same occupation in more
definite terms. The old English ‘brayle’ (from the
Norman ‘braie’ or ‘braye,’ meaning ‘breeches’) was
a waistband merely, a kind of strap, oftentimes
attached to and part of the trousers themselves. The
nautical phrase of ‘brailing up sails’ is, I fear, the
only relic we possess conversationally of this once
useful term. A ‘brailer’ (‘Roger le Braeler,’ A.,
‘Stephen le Brayeler,’ X.) or ‘bregirdler’ (‘John le
Bregerdelere,’ X.) was, of course, a manufacturer of
these. Maundeville, in his ‘Travels,’ speaks of a
‘breek-girdille’ (p. 50). The now almost universal
suspender was a later introduction, the names of
‘Bracegirdler’ and ‘Bracegirdle,’ which are not yet
extinct, denoting, seemingly, the process of change by
which the one gradually made way for the other. A
‘brace,’ from the Latin ‘brachium,’ the arm, encircles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>the shoulder as a ‘bracelet’ does the wrist. It is
quite possible, however, they may be but a form of
‘breek-girdle.’ ‘Ivo le Glover’ or ‘Christiana la
Glovere’ have left descendants in plenty, but they
had to fight a hard battle with such naturalized
foreigners as ‘Geoffery le Ganter’ or ‘Philip le Gaunter.’
At one time these latter had firmly established
themselves as the nominees of the manufacture, and
the only wonder to me is how we managed to prevent
‘gants’ from superseding ‘gloves’ in our common
parlance. The connexion of the ‘gauntlet’ with
military dress, however, has preserved that form of
the term from decay. Both ‘Ganter’ and ‘Gaunter,’
I need scarcely say, are firmly set in our midst.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now we must descend once more till we come
to the lower extremities, and in a day of so much
tramping it on foot we need not feel surprised if we
find many memorials of this branch of the personal
outfit. The once common expression for a shoemaker
or cobbler was that of <i>souter</i>.<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c009'><sup>[356]</sup></a> It is of constant
occurrence in our olden writers. Thus the
Malvern Dreamer speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Plowmen and pastours,</div>
      <div class='line'>And othere commune laborers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sowters and shepherdes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Elsewhere, too, he uses the feminine form when he
makes mention of—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Cesse the souteresse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The masculine term, I need not remind Scotchmen,
is still in colloquial use across the Border, and that
it was once so in England our many ‘Souters,’ ‘Sowters,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>and ‘Suters,’ and ‘Suitors,’ misleading as these
latter are, are sufficient evidence. Such entries as
‘Andrew le Soutere,’ ‘Robert le Souter,’ or ‘Richard
le Sutor’ are common to old registers. In the
‘Promptorium Parvulorum’ ‘sowtare’ is defined as a
‘cordewaner’ or ‘cordynare,’ and this at once brings
us to our ‘Cordwaners,’ ‘Cordiners,’ and ‘Codners.’
They were so termed because the goatskin leather
they used came, or was supposed to have come, from
Cordova in Spain. In the ‘Rime of Sire Thopas,’
that personage is thus described:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His hair, his beard was like safroun,</div>
      <div class='line'>That to his girdle raught adown,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His shoon of cordewane;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Brugges were his hosen brown,</div>
      <div class='line'>His robe was of ciclatoun,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That cost many a jane.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the ‘Libel on English Policy,’ too, we find it said
of Portugal—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Their londe hath oyle, wyne, osey, wex, and grain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fygues, reysyns, honey and cordwayne.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the Hundred Rolls it is represented by such a
name as ‘Hugh le Cordwaner’ or ‘Ranulph le Cordewaner.’<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c009'><sup>[357]</sup></a>
‘William le Corviser,’ from the same records,
or ‘Durand le Corveser,’ held a name which struggled
for some time for a place, but had finally to collapse.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c009'><sup>[358]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>‘Cobbler’ (‘Richard le Cobeler,’ A.), though it has
existed as a name of occupation fully as long as any
of the above, has, I believe, never been able so far to
overcome the dislike to the fact of its being a mere
mending or patchwork trade as to obtain for itself an
hereditary place in our nomenclature. ‘Cosier’ has
fared better, as have ‘Clouter’ and ‘Cloutman,’ relics
of the old ‘John’ or ‘Stephen le Clutere,’ why I do
not know. We all remember how the inhabitants of
Gibeon ‘did work wilily, and went and made as if
they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon
their asses, and wine bottles, old and rent, and bound
up, and old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old
garments upon them.’ Another name we may notice
here is that of ‘Patten-maker,’ a ‘James Patyn-makere’
being found enrolled in a Norwich guild of
1385. Cocke Lorelle mentions among others:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Alys Easy a gay tale-teller,</div>
      <div class='line'>Also Peter Patynmaker.<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c009'><sup>[359]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>A patten seems in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
to have been very similar to our clog, only that
the former was more easily put on and off. It was of
a wooden sole, rimmed with iron. We find in 1464
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>the Patynmakers of London presenting a grievance in
that the fletchers alone were allowed to use aspen-wood,
whereas it was the ‘lightest tymbre to make of
patyns or clogges.’ (Rot. Parl. iv. 567.) Mr. Way,
in his Notes to the ‘Promptorium Parvulorum,’ says
they were worn much by ecclesiastics to protect the
feet from chill when treading the cold bare pavements
of the churches, and he quotes a Harleian MS. dated
1390 regarding an archiepiscopal visitation at York:
‘Item, omnes ministri ecclesie pro majore parte utuntur
in ecclesiâ et in processione <i>patens</i> et <i>clogges</i> contra
honestatem ecclesie, et antiquam consuetudenem
capituli.’ The patten-maker was evidently of some
importance at this time.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c009'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps fashion never went to such an absurd extreme
as it did in the fourteenth century with respect
to wearing peaked shoes. An old poem entitled the
‘Complaint of the Ploughman,’ says of the friars, and
alluding to their inconsistencies, that they wear—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Cutted clothes to shewe their hewe,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With long pikes on their shoon:</div>
      <div class='line'>Our Goddes Gospell is not trewe</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Either they serve the devill or none.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Piers Plowman, too, speaks of a knight coming to be
dubbed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To geten him gilte spurs</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or galoches y-couped.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This last reminds us that they were commonly styled
‘copped shoon.’ Such a sobriquet as ‘Hugh le Coppede’
or ‘John le Copede’ would seem to refer to this.
Probably the owner had carried on the practice to an
even more extravagant length than his neighbours, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>very likely he was one of those who caused a law to be
passed in 1463 forbidding any knight, or any one
beneath that rank, to wear any shoes or boots having
pikes passing the length of two inches! Even this
curtailment, I imagine, would astonish the weak
minds of pedestrians in the nineteenth century. Of
a similar craft with the shoemaker came ‘the hosier’ or
‘chaucer,’ the latter of which has become, surnominally,
so famous in English literature. Though now
obsolete, such a name as ‘Robert le Chaucer’ or
‘William le Chaucier’ was anything but uncommon
at this time. Like ‘Suter,’ above-mentioned, it has a
Latin source, its root being ‘calcearius.’ Chausses,
however, were not so much boots as a kind of leathern
breeches worn over mail armour. There is probably,
therefore, but little distinction to be made between
them and the ‘hose’ of former days, though it is
somewhat odd that leather, which once undoubtedly
was the chief object of the hosier’s attention, should
now in his shop be conspicuous by its absence. While
‘Chaucer’ has long ago become extinct, ‘Hosier’ or
‘Hozier’ is firmly established in our nomenclature.
Thus we see that clothing is not without its mementoes.</p>
<p class='c007'>A curious surname is presented for our notice in
our ‘Dubbers,’ not to be confounded with our ‘Daubers’
already mentioned. To ‘dub’ was to dress,
or trim, or decorate. Thus, with regard to military
equipment, Minot says in one of his political songs—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Knightes were there well two score</div>
      <div class='line'>That were new dubbed to that dance.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is thus we have acquired our phrase ‘to dub a
knight.’ The term, however, became very general in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>the sense of embellishing, rather than mere dressing,
and it is to this use of the word we owe the surname.
Thus, in the ‘Liber Albus’ we find a ‘Peter le
Dubbour’ recorded, whose trade was to furbish up
old clothes; he was a fripperer in fact. In the York
Pageant, already referred to more than once, we see
the ‘Dubbers’ walking in procession between the
‘Bookbinders’ and ‘Limners,’ and here they were
evidently mere trimmers or decorators externally of
books. In another register we find a ‘dubbour,’ so
called because as a hawker of fish he was in the habit
of putting all the fine ones at the top of his basket, a
trick still in vogue in that profession, I fear.<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c009'><sup>[361]</sup></a> In all
these cases we see that ‘adornment’ or ‘embellishment’
is the main idea. I need not remind my
more North-country readers how every gardener
still speaks of ‘dubbing’ when he heaps up afresh
the soil about his flowers and plants. The old forms
of the name were ‘Jordan le Dubber,’ ‘Payen le
Dubbour,’ and ‘Ralph le Douber,’ which last most
nearly approaches its root, the old Norman-French
‘adouber,’ to arrange.</p>

<p class='c007'>A curious occupation is preserved from oblivion in
our somewhat rare ‘Raffmans.’ We have the root
meaning of the word in our ‘reft’ and ‘bereft,’ implicative
of that which is snatched away or swept off.
Thus we still use ‘riff-raff’ in regard to the off-scouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>of the people. A raff-merchant was a dealer
in lumber of any kind. In the Guild of Saint George,
Norwich, 1385, we find not merely the name of ‘John
Raffman,’ but such entries as ‘Robert Smith, raffman,’
or ‘John Smith, rafman.’ The term ‘raff’ for
a low fellow is not yet obsolete, and Tennyson, when
he says</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Let raffs be rife in prose or rhyme,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>is only using a sobriquet which, until recently, was a
very familiar one in the mouths of our peasantry. I
have placed the surname here because I doubt not
the occupation whence it sprung was chiefly in respect
of trimmings, and the shearings of cloth, wool, and
such like articles of merchandise.</p>
<p class='c007'>Another surname we must consider here is that
belonging to ‘Ketel le Mercer’ or ‘Henry le Mercer,’
now found also as ‘Marcer.’ We see in the very
title that the term has engrossed a sense not strictly
its own, and that, though we visit the mercer’s shop
for silken goods, he was originally a dealer in every
kind of ware. He represented in mediæval times,
in fact, the storekeeper of our colonies. Indeed I
believe that to this day in some of our more retired
country parts the mercer will supply his customers
with haberdashery, drugs, draperies, hardware, and
all general wants, saving actual comestibles. Mr.
Lower quotes an old political song against the friars,
in which this more correct sense of the word is
conveyed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For thai have nought to live by,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They wandren here and there,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dele with divers marcerye</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Right as thai pedlars were.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Our ‘Chaloners’ and ‘Challenors,’ representatives
of such old names as ‘Peter le Chaloner,’ ‘Jordan
le Chaluner,’ or ‘Nicholas le Chalouner,’ originated
in a foreign but most useful manufacture. Chalons-sur-Marne,
at this time one of the most thriving towns
of the Continent, was chiefly renowned for its woollen
and worsted stuffs, and a peculiar coverlet of this
sort, called by the special name of a ‘chalon,’ became
celebrated over the more civilized world. In the
‘Reves’ Tale’ we are told of the miller that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In his owen chambre he made a bedde</div>
      <div class='line'>With shetes, and with chalons fair yspredde.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c009'><sup>[362]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Any importer or manufacturer of these was a
‘Chaloner.’ In a public solemn pageant held in 1415
in the City of York, at the end of a list of trades to be
represented, there follows this: ‘It is ordained that
the Porters and Coblers should go first, then, of the
right, the Wevers and Cordwaners: on the left, the
Fullers, Cutlers, Girdellers, Chaloners, Carpenters, and
Taillyoures: then the better sort of citizens,’ etc.
(‘History and Antiquities of York,’ vol. ii. p. 126.)
The trade name seems to have died out about the end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>of the fifteenth century. How corrupted a word may
become in the lapse of time may be seen in the
modern ‘shalloon,’ a term used for a species of
worsted cloth. In such a name as ‘Hugh le Shetare’
or ‘Roger le Shetere’ we recognize him who provided
that other portion of the bed gear which is referred to
in the extract from Chaucer. This name is now
extinct. Not so, however, our ‘Quilters,’ who still
thrive in our midst hale and hearty, and need never
fear obsoletism. Doubtless, as the cold of winter set
in, and its warm padded qualities began to be appreciated,
the quilters would be busy enough in providing
such a coverlet as this. ‘Quiltmaker’ (‘John le Quyltemaker,’
H.) is also found as a variation of the above:
an old poem mentions among others—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Quyltemakers, shermen, and armorers;</div>
      <div class='line'>Borlers, tapestry-work makers, and dyers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Such a name as ‘Christiana le Heldere’ or ‘Robert le
Holdere’ must, I doubt not, be set here, both forms
being still in existence. They belonged, I think, to the
craft of upholdsters or upholders, at this time confined,
it would seem, entirely to the manufacture and sale
of mattresses, bolsters, pillows, and quilts, anything
of a padded nature connected with bed furniture.<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c009'><sup>[363]</sup></a>
The insertion of flocks and feathers and the stitching
together of such would seem to be a woman’s work,
and this is the clue, I suspect, to the fact of our now
using the feminine form of upholdster. There is a
curious complaint made to Parliament in 1495, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>the metropolitan upholders, that ‘Quyltes, mattres,
and cussions (were) stuffed with horse hair, fen downe,
neetis here, deris here (deers’ hair), and gotis here,
which is wrought in lyme fattes and by the hete of
mannys body the savour and taste is so abhomynable
and contagious that many of the King’s subgettis
thereby been destroied.’<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c009'><sup>[364]</sup></a> It is prayed, therefore,
that only one kind of stuff be allowed to be inserted
in any one of these articles (‘Stat: of Realm,’ Henry
VII.). In ‘Henry le Canevacer’ or ‘Richard le
Canevacer’ we are carried back to a class of now all
but entirely decayed trade. The canvaser, of course,
turned out canvas, and this more especially for bags
for the conveyance of the raw wool, or for tapestry
purposes. In an old poem relating to German imports,
it is said at the close—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Coleyne threde, fustaine, and canvase,</div>
      <div class='line'>Carde, bokeram, of olde time thus it wase.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Tapestry work would engage much of this. Hangings
of this kind, ere wainscot came into use, were the ordinary
decorations of the baronial apartment, covering
as they generally did the entire length of the lower
wall. In the ‘Boke of Curtasye’ we are told of the
duties of one officer—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tapetis of Spayne on flore by side</div>
      <div class='line'>That sprad shall be for pompe and pryde,</div>
      <div class='line'>The chambur sydes rygt to the dore</div>
      <div class='line'>He hangs with tapetis that ben fulle store.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>The name of ‘Tapiser,’ for one who wove this
article, is familiarized to us as that of one of the immortal
company who sat down together at the ‘Tabard’
in Southwark. Our modern ‘Tapsters,’ I doubt not,
afford but another example of a surname engrossing
what have been originally two separate and distinct
titles. In an old sacred pageant given in York in 1415,
amongst other trades represented we find coupled
together the ‘Couchers’ and ‘Tapisers.’<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c009'><sup>[365]</sup></a> Our ‘Couchers’
and ‘Couchmans’ are thus explained. They
were evidently engaged less in the wooden framework,
as we might have supposed, than in the manufacture
of the cushions that covered it, and doubtless, like
the broiderer mentioned above, worked in gold and
silver and coloured threads the raised figures thereon.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c009'><sup>[366]</sup></a>
Thus we must ally them with such names as ‘Robert
le Dosier’ or ‘Richard le Dosyere,’ makers of the
‘doss,’ a technical term given at this time for cushions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>or stools worked in tapestry.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c009'><sup>[367]</sup></a> Thus the same book
which I have just quoted says of the groom’s duties—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The dosurs, curtines to hang in halle,</div>
      <div class='line'>These offices needs do he shalle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>As a specific name for productions of this class the
word is now quite obsolete, though familiar enough
in early days; tapestry indeed, in general, has ceased
to be popular, and is now all but entirely confined
professionally to the weaving of carpets, and as an
amateur art among ladies to those figured screens so
much in vogue not more than one or two generations
ago, traces of which still remain in the framed embroideries
yet lingering in many of our drawing-rooms—embroideries
of cats with grizzly whiskers and tawny
terriers—embroideries which as children we heard
with bated breath had been worked by our grandmothers
when they were little girls, and thus we
realised for the first time, not so much that they had
done these wonderful things as that they had once
been small at all, like ourselves.</p>
<p class='c007'>We have no surname to represent the weaving of
carpets, as this was an introduction of much later
date than most of our other household comforts in
the way of furniture. In Brand’s ‘Popular Antiquities’
an interesting quotation is given from Hentzner’s
‘Itinerary,’ who, describing Queen Elizabeth’s Presence
Chamber at Greenwich, says, ‘The floor, after
the English fashion, was strewed with hay.’ The
strewing of church pews with rushes was common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>until recent times, and in the North of England the
peculiar customs attaching to the ‘Rush-bearing,’ a
kind of ‘wakes,’ are not yet extinct. It is fair to add,
however, that carpets were in course of introduction
at the beginning of the sixteenth century; an old
poem of that date mentions—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Broudurers, strayners, and carpyte-makers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Spooners, turners, and hatters.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Before proceeding any further we had better introduce
our ‘Lavenders,’ or washers, for be it linen or
woollen stuff, be it garment for the back or covering
for the bed, all needed washing then as now. The
contracted feminine ‘laundress’ is still in common
use. That the masculine form, however, was early
applied to the other sex is proved in the ‘Legend of
Good Women,’ where we are told—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Envie is lavender of the court alway,</div>
      <div class='line'>For she ne parteth neither night ne day.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The gradation from ‘lavenderie’ to ‘laundry’ is
marked by Stowe, who in his ‘Chronicles’ writes it
‘laundery.’ By similar contractions our ‘Lavenders’
are now found also in the other forms of ‘Launder’
and ‘Lander.’ An old poem says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thou shalt be my launder,</div>
      <div class='line'>To washe and keep clean all my gere.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c009'><sup>[368]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Alicia la Lavendar’ figures in the Hundred Rolls.
Doubtless, like our more Saxon ‘Washers,’ she was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>professional washerwoman. The stiffening process, of
infinitely more consequence then than now, has left its
mark in such a name as ‘Ralph le Starkere,’ or even
in that of ‘William Starcman,’ starch and stark being
once but synonymous words. Whether it were the
carefully pinched wimple or the kerchief, whether it
were of silk or lawn, both alike required all the
rigidity that could be imparted to them, would the
head be befittingly adorned. Employed, therefore,
either in the sale of the starch itself or in the work
of stiffening the dress, we find men of such a title as
the above. Doubtless they are referred to by the
author of ‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote’ where he speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Butlers, sterchers, and mustardmakers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hardeware men, mole seekers, and ratte-takers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>From the outer we may now naturally and fitly
turn to the provision for the inner man. Nor are we
without interesting relics also in this respect. We
have already described the process by which the flour
was provided. The agencies in the towns for the sale
of this, and the uses to which it was put, are all more
or less well defined, and well established also in our
present directories. I do not know whether French
rolls had obtained celebrity so early as this, but the
name of ‘Richard Frenshbaker’ would seem at least
to give some kind of credence to the supposition.
There can be no doubt, however, that he dealt in a
fancy way, for in solid bread-baking the Saxon
‘Baker’ has ever kept his hands in the kneading-trough,
and need never fear, so far as our nomenclature
is concerned, being ousted therefrom. The
feminine form has become almost equally well established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>among us, ‘Bagster’ or ‘Baxter’<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c009'><sup>[369]</sup></a> or ‘Backster’
(the latter spelling found in Foxe’s Roll of Marian
martyrs) being among other forms of the old female
‘bakester.’ Piers Plowman speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Baksteres, and brewesteres,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bochiers manye;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and such good folk as ‘Elias le Baxter’ or ‘Ralph le
Bakster’ or ‘Giliana le Bacster’ are very plentifully
represented in our olden registers.<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c009'><sup>[370]</sup></a> Still the foreigner
did not give way without a struggle. We have
‘Pollinger,’ ‘Bullinger,’ ‘Bollinger,’ and ‘Ballinger,’ as
corruptions of the ‘boulanger’ or ‘Richard le Bulenger,’
as he is recorded. In our ‘Furners’ we see the
representatives of such a name as ‘William le Furner’
or ‘Walter le Fernier,’ he who looked to the oven,
while in the all but unaltered form of ‘Pester’ we
may still not uncommonly meet with the descendants
of many an old ‘Richard le Pestour’ or ‘Herman le
Pestur,’ who had spent the best of his days in the
bakehouse. Such a name as ‘John Pastemakere’ or
‘Gregory le Pastemakere’ or ‘Andrew le Pyebakere,’
which once existed, reminds us of the pastrycook, a
member, as he then was, no doubt, of a by no means
unimportant fraternity—that of the ‘Pastelers’ or
‘Pie-bakers.’ An old poem speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Drovers, cokes, and pulters,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yermongers, pybakers, and waferers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Best known, however, to most people would he be
under the simple professional name of ‘cook.’ I need
not remind any student of olden English records how
familiar is ‘Roger le Coke’ or ‘William le Cook’ or
‘John Cokeman,’ nor will he be astonished at his
being so well represented in all those forms in the
directories of the nineteenth century. I could give
endless references to show that this term was not
confined to the kitchen servitor. The ‘City Archives’
give us an ordinance passed 2 Rich. II. (<span class='small'>A.D.</span> 1378) by
the ‘Cooks and Pastelers,’ as an associated company,
and Piers Plowman speaks of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Punishing on pillories,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or on pynnyng stools,</div>
      <div class='line'>Brewesters, Bakers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bochers, and Cookes,</div>
      <div class='line'>For these be men upon molde (earth)</div>
      <div class='line'>That most harm worken</div>
      <div class='line'>To the poor people.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Cook’ or ‘Coke’ certainly holds a high position in
the scale of frequency at present, and, as I have had
occasion to notice in another chapter, is one of those
few tradal names that have taken to them the filial
desinence, ‘Cookson’ being by no means uncommon.
Of all these we might have said much, but to mention
them must suffice, and to pass on. Solid bread-baking,
however, as I have just hinted, was not the
sole employment of this nature in early days. A
poem I have recently quoted speaks of ‘waferers.’
Our ‘Wafers,’ relics of the old ‘Simon’ or ‘Robert le
Wafre,’ seem to have confined themselves all but
entirely to the provision of eucharistic bread, though
they were probably vendors also of those sweet and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>spiced cakes which, under the name of ‘marchpanes,’
were decidedly popular. Among other gifts that
Absolom the clerk gave Alison, Chaucer hints of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wafers piping hot out of the glede,<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c009'><sup>[371]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and the ‘Pardoner,’ in enumerating the company of
lewd folks of Flanders, speaks of ‘fruitsters,’ ‘singers
with harps,’ and ‘waferers.’ Piers Plowman puts
them amid still more disreputable associates. No
doubt, true to the old adage, ‘near the church, never
in it,’ they were wont to hang about the sacred edifice
abroad and at home, offering their traffic to the devouter
worshippers as they entered in. We ourselves
know how searing to heart and conscience is such a
life as this. That all were not of this kind we are
reminded by the will of an Archbishop of York of the
thirteenth century, who therein bequeaths a certain
sum to two ‘waferers,’ evidently on account of their
exemplary conduct while conducting their trade at
the Minster door.</p>
<p class='c007'>Chaucer, describing the prioress, says that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With rosted flesh, and milk, and wastel brede,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>she fed her small hounds. Cakes of wastel were of
the purest flour and most careful bake, and were only
second to the simnel in quality. Wasteler, found in
such an entry as ‘John Wasteler,’ is extinct, but the
shorter ‘Wastel’ still exists in our midst. Probably,
in the latter case, it was originally but a sobriquet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>affixed to a baker of this peculiar kind of bread.
It is in a similar manner, I doubt not, arose such
early nicknames as ‘William Wytebred,’ or ‘John
Holibread,’ or ‘Roger Blancpain,’ or ‘Josce Barlibred,’
or ‘Matilda Havercake,’ or ‘Lambert Simnel,’ the
latter a name familiarized to the youngest student of
English history. Strange to say, ‘Barlibred’ is the
only one of this list that has disappeared from our
directories, although ‘Barleycorn’ was in existence,
I believe, but a few years ago. But to keep more
strictly to tradesmen: I have no doubt myself it is
here we must place our ‘Mitcheners,’ as makers of
the ‘mitche’ or ‘mitchkin.’ The diminutive was
the modern cracknel, while the larger seems to have
been a small loaf of mixed flour. Chaucer, in his
praise of contentment, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For he that hath mitches tweine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ne value in his demeine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Liveth more at ease, and more is rich</div>
      <div class='line'>Than doeth he that is chich (niggardly),</div>
      <div class='line'>And in his barne hath sooth to saine,</div>
      <div class='line'>A hundred mavis of wheat grain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I have, however, no proof of the connexion I deem
exists, so I merely mention it and pass on. We
are more certain about our rare ‘Flawners’ and
‘Flanners,’<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c009'><sup>[372]</sup></a> once the manufacturers of the ‘flaon’
or ‘flawn,’ so popular as to have left its mark in
our ‘Pancake Tuesday.’ Caxton, in his ‘Boke for
Travellers,’ says, ‘of mylke and of eggs men make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>flawnes.’ In the story of Havelok the Dane, too,
mention is made of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Brede an chese, butere and milk,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pasties and flaunes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>A ‘Roger le Flaoner’ comes in the London Corporation
records, <span class='small'>A.D.</span> 1307, while much about the
same time I find a ‘Walter le Flawner’ in the Parliamentary
writs.</p>
<p class='c007'>I have kept our ‘Panyers’ and ‘Panniers’ till the
last, because there is just a shade of doubt as to
whether they owe their name to the manufacture of
the basket so called or to the hawking of bread, the
very practice of which custom, so familiar as it was
then, has given us the term. The original meaning
of ‘pannier,’ the French ‘panier,’ was bread-basket,
and the word seems to have acquired a peculiar prominence
from the fact that in mediæval times bakers,
through being the subjects of a careful supervision,
were forbidden to sell their bread anywhere but in
the public market—nay, so particular were the
authorities with regard to this that an officer was
specially appointed to watch the ‘hutches,’ boxes, or
baskets in which the loaves were exposed. A surname
‘Robert le Huchereve’ is even found in the Guildhall
records as a relic of this. We can thus readily understand
how hawkers of these portable covers or baskets
would acquire the sobriquet of ‘panyers.’ Certain it
is we find such entries as ‘Simon le Pannier,’ ‘Robert
le Pannere,’ ‘Amiscus Panarius,’ or ‘Geoffrey Panyman,’
while in another register the occupation of
‘panyere’ is distinctly mentioned. We can equally
readily understand how from this the term itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>would, in course of time, obtain a wider and more
general sense. That it has done so the donkey’s panniers
are a proof. It is, however, somewhat strange,
when we reflect upon it, that perhaps the last thing
we should expect to see borne in this fashion in the
present day would be that very article to which the
receptacle itself owed its name.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is somewhat remarkable that while our directories
possess many records of the early manufacture
of and traffic in cheese, yet there are no names whatever
in the present day, I believe, and barely any in
the past, which are associated with the most important
of all country produce—butter.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c009'><sup>[373]</sup></a> The most satisfactory
clue to the difficulty will be to suppose that
the cheese-merchant of that day, as often in the
present, dealt in both articles. This is the more
likely, as the many sobriquets given to dealers in
cheese in the fourteenth century would appear to give
that edible, important as it was and is, a greater
prominence than singly it deserved. Thus we find
such names as ‘Edward le Cheseman’ or ‘Robert le
Chesemaker,’ ‘John le Chesewright,’ or ‘William
le Cheswright,’ or ‘Alen le Chesmongere,’ as representatives
of the Saxons, figuring somewhat conspicuously
in the registers of the period.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c009'><sup>[374]</sup></a> For the foreign
element, too, cognomens were not wanting. ‘Benedict’
or ‘Michael le Casiere’ may even now be living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>in our ‘Cayzers,’ if they be not but another form of
‘Kaiser,’ and ‘Wilkin le Furmager’ or ‘William le
Formager’ in our ‘Firmingers,’ is in no risk of immediate
oblivion. The majority of the Saxon forms, I
need scarcely add, are also thriving in our midst.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may seem somewhat strange that ‘grocer,’ of
all trades the most important, so far as the kitchen is
concerned, should be so rarely represented in our
nomenclature. But the reason is simple enough. To
sell in the gross, or wholesale, was a second and later
step in commercial practice. A ‘John Guter, Grossarius,’
appears in the London City Rolls so early as
1310, but it had scarcely become a familiar name of
trade till the close of the fourteenth century.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c009'><sup>[375]</sup></a> In
1363 a statute of Edward III. speaks concerning
‘Merchauntz nomez Grossers,’ so termed because
they ‘engrossent totes maners des marchandises vendables,’
and then enhanced the price on each separate
article. Before this they had been known as the
Pepperers, or Spicers Guild, such names as ‘John le
Espicer’ or ‘Nicholas le Espicer’ occurring not unfrequently
at this period. Spice, indeed, was the then
general term for all manner of drugs, aromatic and
pungent, which were brought into England by foreign
and especially Venetian merchants from the East.
These were carried up and down the country again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>by the itinerant traders, so many of whom I have
already referred to in a previous chapter. An old
song, written against the mendicant friars, relates
that, among other of their vagaries—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Many a dyvers spyse</div>
      <div class='line'>In bagges about they bear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>As I have just stated, however, the term ‘Grocer’
superseded that of ‘Spicer,’ and as such seems to
have confined its dealings to the modernly received
limit at an early date. As we must have already seen,
each want had always hitherto been met by its own
special dealer. With us now the Cutler would supply
all the ‘Knifesmith’ and ‘Spooner’ then separately
furnished; while our ‘Ironmongers’ or ‘Hosiers’
or ‘Upholdsters’ would each swallow up half-a-dozen
of former occupations. Thus it was here. Our ‘John
le Saucers’ or ‘Ada la Saucers’ provided salt pickle.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c009'><sup>[376]</sup></a>
As with the ‘Frankelein,’ so with many another
there—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wo was his cook, but if his sauce were</div>
      <div class='line'>Poinant and sharpe, and redy all his gear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Peter le Salter’ or ‘Hugh Saltman’ furnished forth
the chloride itself; ‘William le Mustarder’ or ‘Peter le
Mustardman,’ or ‘Alice Mustard-maker,’ the mustard;
‘Thomas le Pepperer,’<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c009'><sup>[377]</sup></a> now spelt ‘Pepper,’ the pepper;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>‘Ralph le Soper’ or ‘Adam le Savonier,’ the soap.
Each set before his customers’ eyes those peculiar
articles of household consumption their names severally
represent. All these, having flourished in the
earlier age, established for themselves a better place
in our register than our rare ‘Grosers’ or ‘Grossers,’
who in this respect only appeared in time to save
themselves from oblivion, though they have long ago
revenged themselves on their humbler brethren by
swallowing up entire the occupations they followed.
It is curious to note that in later days, through the
various accessions of luxury, the result in well-nigh
every case of foreign discovery, even ‘Grocer’ has
failed to comprehend all. In our country villages
we all but invariably find added ‘and licensed dealer
in tea, coffee, tobacco, snuff, &amp;c.’ In our towns,
however, this addendum has been dropped, and a
‘grocer’s shop’ is the place we turn to, without
thought of refusal, for these modern introduced
luxuries. What changes in our domestic resources
are here presented for our notice! In my previous
chapter it was the over-abundance of certain rural
and primitive surnames which told the story of the
times in which they sprang. The contrary is here the
case. It is in the absence of particular names, some
of which I have already noticed, we have the best
guide to the extraordinary changes that have taken
place in our household economy. Look at our tea-table.
Already in the two short centuries from its
introduction this article has given its name to a
special meal, having thrown the once afternoon supper
into a nocturnal repast. Even Shakespeare could only
say—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>Now can I break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep.<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c009'><sup>[378]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>How strangely would it have affected our nomenclature
had this and other like novelties been brought in
earlier. We should have had ‘William le Coffyer’
giving us endless anxiety in the endeavour to separate
it from the actual ‘Godfrey le Coffrer.’ We should
have had, too, such folk as ‘John le Riceman,’ ‘Walter
le Snuffer,’ ‘Ralph le Tobacconer,’ shortened into
‘Bacconer,’ and the still more awkward ‘le Potatoman,’
almost as inconvenient as ‘Garlickmonger,’
though doubtless it would have been quickly curtailed
into ‘Taterman’ or ‘Taterer’ or ‘Tatman’ and
‘Tatter,’ and later on again into other forms too
obscure to contemplate. The very recounting of
these changes, which are strictly on a par with other
names of a less hypothetical character, serve to impress
us with the difficulties we have to encounter in
the task of deciphering many of our surnames after
the wear and tear they have undergone through
lapsing generations.</p>
<p class='c007'>But I must not wander. The sale of vegetables
and fruits left its mark in our former ‘John le Fruemongers’
and ‘Ralph le Frueters,’ and ‘Hugh le
Fruters;’ ‘Richard le Graper’ testifying seemingly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>a more specific dealing. Our ‘Butchers’ of course
have been busy enough from the day that the Normans
brought them in. The variety of spelling which
is found in olden records of this name is so great
that I dare not attempt a list, but I believe there still
exist, <i>sans</i> the article, such of the old forms as ‘le
Bouchier,’ ‘le Bowcher,’ and ‘le Bowsher,’ while
‘Botcher’ is at least not altered in sound from ‘le
Bochere’ of the same period—‘Labouchere,’ which
preserves this article, is of more modern introduction
from the Gallic shore. But the Norman was not
without his rivals. Such names as ‘Walter le Fleshmongere,’
or ‘Eudo le Flesshemongere,’ or ‘Richard
le Flesmongere,’<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c009'><sup>[379]</sup></a> prove that the Saxon did not give
up even this branch of daily occupation without a
struggle, and in the two isolated cases of ‘William
Fleschour’ and ‘John Fleshewer’ that I have lit upon
we are reminded that Scotland, with its still flourishing
‘flesher,’ is but the asylum where this truly Saxon
term found its latest retreat. Even yet in England
with the country folk the butchers’ shambles are the
‘flesh-market.’ That ‘Fleshmonger’ was the colloquial
term, we may prove from a list of tradesmen
mentioned in ‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote,’ a poem I have
already quoted several times; reference is there made
to—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Woolemen, vynterers and flesshemongers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Salters, jewelers, and haberdashers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>The ‘Pardoner,’ too, in the same poem, thus begins
his roll—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here is first Cocke Lorelle the Knyght,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Symkyn Emery, mayntenaunce agaynz ryght;</div>
      <div class='line'>With Slyngethryfte Fleshemonger.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>But if not in the common mouth, yet in our rolls
there were two other names of this craft, which we
must not pass over unrecorded. They were those of
‘Carnifex’ and ‘Massacrer,’ both representing the
slaughter-house, I doubt not. The existence of the
former would lead us to suppose that the old Roman
hangsman was settled in our midst, but it was merely
a mediæval Latinism for a butcher.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c009'><sup>[380]</sup></a> After the fashion
of the time nicknames were affixed upon everybody,
and our ‘Butchers’ and ‘Slaughters’ did not escape.
The Hundred Rolls alone register the names of
‘Reginald Cullebol,’ ‘Henry Cullebulloc,’ ‘William
Cullehare,’ and ‘William Culle-hog,’ or in more
modern parlance ‘Kill-bull,’ ‘Kill-bullock,’ Kill-hare,’
and ‘Kill-hog.’ The original and more correct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>‘poulter,’ he who dealt in ‘poults’ or poultry, as we
now term it, has bequeathed his name to our ‘Poulters’
and ‘Pulters.’ Such names as ‘Adam le Puleter,’
or ‘Bernard le Poleter,’ or ‘William le Pulter,’ by the
frequency with which we come across them, show how
much did the farmyard help to provide in these days
for the supply of the dining-table.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I have no peny,</div>
      <div class='line'>Poletes to bugge (buy),</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>says Langland, showing that in his time they were
commonly exhibited for sale. Indeed, the fact that
in the York Festival of 1415 the ‘bouchers’ and
‘pulterers’ walked in procession together clearly
proves their importance at the period in which the
surname arose.</p>
<p class='c007'>We have already mentioned the fishmonger, or
what was practically the fishmonger, the fisherman, in
our last chapter while surveying rural occupations.
Our rare ‘Pessoners’<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c009'><sup>[381]</sup></a> as representative of the Norman,
and common ‘Fishers’ of the Saxon, lived in a day
when under Roman ecclesiastic influences fish was of
infinitely more importance than it is in this nineteenth
century, when it is merely used as a go-between or
mediator to soothe down the differences betwixt soup
and beef. Then the year was dotted with days of
abstinence, or strongly indented with seasons like
Lent. Among the higher circles it mattered but
little. So much had the culinary art excelled in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>respect of fish that such periods as they came round
only brought to the epicurean mind visions of gastronomic
skill that put the sterner and weightier joints
utterly in the background for the time being. Pasties
of herrings, congers, or lampreys were especially popular,
and, judging from the lists of courses contained in
some of our records, that only one of our mediæval
monarchs should have succumbed to the latter is
simply an historic marvel! Dishes too were prepared
from the whale, the porpoise, the grampus, and the
sea-wolf. ‘It is lamentable,’ says, facetiously, a
writer in ‘Chambers’s Book of Days,’ referring to
these viands as Lent repasts, ‘to think how much sin
they thus occasioned among our forefathers, before they
were discovered to be <i>mammalian</i>.’</p>

<p class='c007'>A curious name is found in the Hundred Rolls,
that of ‘Symon Haryngbredere.’ In what particular
way he carried on his occupation I do not know.
‘Richard le Harenger’ is more explicable. Our
‘Conders’ were partners in the fishing excursions of
the above. A full account of their duties may be
found in Cowel’s ‘Interpreter,’ published in 1658.
The conder stood upon the higher cliffs by the sea
coast in the time of herring fishing, and with a staff
or branch of a tree made signs to the boatmen which
way the shoal was going. It seems there is a certain
discoloured aspect of the water as they pass along,
which is more apparent from an elevation than from
the level of the sea.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c009'><sup>[382]</sup></a> In mediæval times the plaice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>was a very favourite dish. The term it usually went
by was that of ‘but.’ Thus it is, I doubt not, we
meet with such entries, as ‘William le Butor’ or
‘Hugh Butmonger.’ From some fancied resemblance
to this fish, too, it would be that such humorous
sobriquets as ‘Walter le But’ or ‘John le But’ would
arise.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while good and solid food could thus be purchased
on every hand, we must not forget drink, for
our forefathers were great tipplers. I have already
mentioned our ‘William le Viners’ or ‘Roger le
Vinours,’ in most cases, I doubt not, strictly cultivators
of that plant on English soil. None the less
certain, however, is it that our many early ‘John le
Vineturs’ or ‘Alexander le Vineters’ were also, as
merchants, employed in the importation of the varied
wines of the Continent into our land. How abundant
and how diverse they were an old poem shall tell us—</p>

<p class='c017'>The entry ‘Adam le Wyneter’ reminds us that in all
probability it is to our early wine-merchants also we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>owe our ‘Winters.’ ‘Walter le Brewers,’ or ‘Emma le
Brewsteres,’ or ‘Lawrence Beerbrewers,’<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c009'><sup>[383]</sup></a> abound on
every hand. We are reminded of the last by ‘Cocke
Lorelle’—</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Chymney-swepers, and costerde-mongers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lodemen and berebrewers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The Norman equivalent for our ‘brewer’ was ‘bracer,’
and thus it is we meet with such a name as ‘Stephen
le Bracer’ or ‘Clarissa la Braceresse.’ Latinized
forms are found in ‘Reginald Braciator’ or ‘Letitia
Braciatrix.’ Brewing was at first entirely in the hands
of women. We have here ‘brewster,’ ‘braceress,’
and ‘braciatrix,’ and such phrases as ‘alewife’ and
the obsolete ‘brewife’ (though it lingered on till
Shakespeare’s day) show the ale-making and ale-selling
business to have been mainly hers. ‘Malter’<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c009'><sup>[384]</sup></a>
and ‘Maltster’ or ‘Malster’ both exist, but the latter
has ever denoted the avocation.<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c009'><sup>[385]</sup></a> ‘Tapper’ and
‘Tapster,’ too, are both occupants of our directories,
but as a term of industry the latter has ever held its
own.<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c009'><sup>[386]</sup></a> It is the same with several other occupations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>which we have already noticed. It is so with ‘bread-baking,’
manifesting a woman’s work. As we have
already seen, the familiar expression in olden times
was ‘bakester,’ now represented by our ‘Baxters.’ It
is so with weaving. Our nomenclature, as I have
previously shown, still preserves the ‘Webster’ and
the ‘Kempster’ from being forgotten. In the winter
evening, as the logfire crackled on the hearth, and
while the good man was chopping wood, or tending
his cattle, or mending his outdoor gear, who but his
wife should be drawing woof and warp in the chimney
nook? Whose work but hers should this be to clothe
with her own thrifty fingers the backs of them who
belonged to her? But, as with the others, her work
in time became less a home occupation than a public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>craft, and thus it got into the hands of the male
creation. While ‘Spinner’ still flourishes as a surname,
the feminine ‘spinster’ never obtained a place
in our nomenclature.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c009'><sup>[387]</sup></a> This is no doubt to be attributed
to that early position it took in regard to
female relationship, which it still holds. This would
naturally prevent it from losing its strictly feminine
character.<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c009'><sup>[388]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A vintner went commonly by the name of a wine
tunner, tunner itself being the ordinary term for one
engaged in casking liquor. ‘Tun’ rather than ‘barrel’
was in use. In the ‘Confessio Amantis’ it is said of
Jupiter that he—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hath in his cellar, as men say,</div>
      <div class='line'>Two townes full of lovedrink.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus have arisen such words as ‘tunnel’ or ‘tun-dish,’
the vessel with broad rim and narrow neck, used for
transferring the wine from cask to bottle. That our
nomenclature should possess tokens of all this was
inevitable. We find such names as ‘Edmund le
Tonder’ (F.F.),<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c009'><sup>[389]</sup></a> ‘William Tunder’ (F.F.), ‘William le
Toneleur’ (H.), ‘William le Tonier’ (H.), ‘Richard le
Tundur’ (T.), ‘Hugh le Tunder’ (A.), or ‘Ralph le
Toneler’ (A.) Till the close of the fifteenth century
wine of home-production was the common drink, for,
though beer was not by any means unknown to us, it
was not till the Flemings brought us the hop that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>became a familiar beverage. We all know the old
couplet—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hops, Reformation, baize, and beer,</div>
      <div class='line'>Came into England all in one year.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Previous to this various bitter ingredients had been
admixtured, chiefly, however, wormwood. ‘John de
la Bruere’ or ‘William de Bruario’ are the local surnames
met with in early records.</p>
<p class='c007'>But we have been wandering. The Mayor of
York in 1273 was ‘John le Espicer, aut Apotecarius’<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c009'><sup>[390]</sup></a>
(so the record is put), and while the two trades were
distinct in character, there can be no doubt at the
period referred to there would be much in common
between them. The one would sell certain spices
and drugs as ingredients for dishes, while the other
disposed of the same for medicinal uses. Our ‘Potticarys,’
of course, represent the latter. The term itself,
professionally speaking, is fast becoming obsolete,
having been forced into the background by our
‘chemists’ and ‘druggists.’ But in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries it was the one name for all
such. In the ‘Pardoner’s Tale’ the abbreviated form<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c009'><sup>[391]</sup></a>
is familiarly used—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>And forth he goth, no longer would he tarry,</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the town unto a Potecary,</div>
      <div class='line'>And praied him that he him wolde sell</div>
      <div class='line'>Some poison, that he might his ratouns (rats) quell.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Such men as ‘John le Chirurgien’ or ‘Thomas le
Surigien’ are occasionally found, but through the fact
of the craft being all but entirely in the hands of the
barber, they are rare, and I do not see that they have
surnominally bequeathed us any descendants. Even
so late as the reign of Elizabeth this connection seems
to have commonly existed. In the orders and rules
for an academy for her wards the following passage
occurs with respect to the teaching of medicine:—‘The
Phisition shall practize to reade Chirurgerie,
because, thorough wante of learning therein, we have
verie few good Chirurgions, yf any at all, by reason
that Chirurgerie is not now to be learned in any other
place than in a Barbor’s shoppe. And in that shoppe
most dawngerous, especially in time of plague, when
the ordinary trimming of men for clenlynes must be
done by those which have to do with infected personnes.’<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c009'><sup>[392]</sup></a>
That ‘Thomas Blodlettere’ and ‘William
Blodlettere’ should be conspicuous by their absence
in modern rolls is not surprising. Their former existence,
however, reminds us how in the past the fleshy
arms of our forefathers were constantly exposed to
this once thought panacea for all physical ills. It has
long ceased, however, to be the resortment it was,
and science, by taking it out of the tonsor’s hands,
has left it to the wiser discretion of a more cultivated
and strictly professional class. We have no traces of
the dentist, as he too was absorbed in the barbitonsorial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>craft. Some lines, quoted by Mr. Hotten
in his interesting book on ‘Signboards,’ remind us of
this—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His pole with pewter basons hung,</div>
      <div class='line'>Black, rotten teeth in order strung,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rang’d cups that in the window stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lined with red rags to look like blood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Did well his threefold trade explain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who shaved, drew teeth, and breathed a vein.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Here, therefore, we see one more explanation of the
plentifulness of our ‘Barbers,’ ‘Barbours,’ ‘Barbors,’
and more uncouth-seeming ‘Barbars.’ The old
records give us an equal or even greater variety in
such registrations as ‘John le Barber,’ ‘Richard le
Barbour,’ ‘Nicholas le Barbur,’ ‘Thomas le Barbitonsor,’
or ‘Ralph Tonsor;’<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c009'><sup>[393]</sup></a> while feminine skill in
operating upon the chins of our forefathers is commemorated
in such an entry as ‘Matilda la Barbaresse.’
It is just possible, however, that she kept an apprentice,
although such things are still to be seen, I believe,
as women-shavers. But the one chief sobriquet for
the medical craft, and the one which, excepting our
‘Barbers,’ has made the deepest indenture upon our
nomenclature, was that of ‘Leech’—<i>was</i>, I say, for
saving in our cow-leeches it is now, professionally
speaking, obsolete. In our many ‘Leeches,’ ‘Leaches,’
and ‘Leachmans,’ however, its reputation is not likely
soon to be forgotten. With the country folk it was
the one familiar term in use. Langland, while speaking
of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>One frere Flaterie,</div>

<p class='c017'>makes mention also of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>Conscience called a Leche</div>

      <div class='line'>And through synne y-wounded.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Le Leche’ is the general spelling of earlier times,
and it is that of the lines just quoted.<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c009'><sup>[394]</sup></a> The Hundred
Rolls furnish us with a ‘Hugh le Leche,’ while
‘Robert le Leche’ figures in the Parliamentary Writs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having just referred to the barber, we may here
introduce an obsolete surname somewhat connected
with his craft, that of ‘le Loveloker.’ In the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries the lovelock was as familiar
as the chignon is in the nineteenth, only that the
former was worn alike by men and women. They
wore curls or plaits of hair, oftentimes adorned with
bows or ribbons, and hung in front of the ear and
about the temples. If false, the hair was fastened by
means of adhesive plaster. In the ‘Affectionate
Shepherd’ it is thus alluded to—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why should thy sweete love-locke hang dangling downe,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Kissing thy girdle-stud with falling pride?</div>
      <div class='line'>Although thy skin be white, thy hair is browne;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oh let not then thy haire thy beautie hide.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>How long this custom existed, and how commonly
the exquisites of the period wore these pendants, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>may judge by the fact of a ‘Walter le Loveloker’
occurring in the Hundred Rolls of the fourteenth
century. Probably he added to this the craft of
peruke-maker, and between the two, I doubt not,
throve and grew fat—for wigs too were an early
institution. The surname of occupation has been
long obsolete, but the simpler ‘Lovelock’ is firmly
set in our registers.</p>
<p class='c007'>In a day when the luxury of gas was unknown,
and the hearth, burning more generally with wood
than coal, would throw but a chequered light athwart
the room, we ought not to be surprised to find the
chandlery business to be somewhat demonstrative,
and so it is. In such a name as ‘Michel le Oyneter’
or ‘Hointer,’ we are reminded of the old melter of
grease, and of the equally old English term ‘to oint,’
for to ‘anoint.’ With him, therefore, we may associate
such of his confrères as ‘William le Candelmaker,’
‘Roger le Chaundeler,’ ‘Richard le Chaundler,’
‘William le Candeler,’<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c009'><sup>[395]</sup></a> or ‘Thomas le Candleman,’
names all in existence formerly, some of which still
abide with us. In ‘William le Cirgier’ we are once
more reminded of the earlier religious rites of our
Church and its many vigils, from a performance of
which he who dealt in wax tapers, or <i>cierges</i>, as they
were then styled, would derive no doubt a steady
gain. In the ‘Romance of the Rose’ we are told—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The nine thousand maidens dere,</div>
      <div class='line'>That beren in Heaven their cierges clere,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of which men rede in church and sing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were take in secular clothing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>With these latter then it is we must associate such a
name as ‘John Wexmaker.’</p>
<p class='c007'>While, however, we are dwelling upon such and
similar wants in the domestic consumption, we are
naturally led to make inquiry concerning the utensils
in fashion at this period, and of those who provided
them. Of drinking vessels we have many, for, as we
have previously hinted, this was a decidedly drinking
age. Chief of all was the ‘Mazerer.’ No word
could be in more familiar use in the day we are speaking
of than the ‘macer’ or ‘maslin,’ carved from the
maple. It was the favourite bowl of all classes of
society. By the rich it was valued according as it
was made from the knotted grain, or chased and
rimmed with gold and silver and precious gems. We
are told of Sire Thopas how that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>They fetched him first the swete win,</div>
      <div class='line'>And made eke in a maselin,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>And real spicerie.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>There is scarce a record of any magnitude or importance
which has not its several surnames derived from
the occupation of carving this cup, and as the term
itself was variously pronounced and spelt, so did the
name vary. For instances the Hundred Rolls give us
‘Adam le Mazerer;’ the Close Rolls, ‘William le
Macerer;’ the Warranty Rolls, ‘William le Mazeliner;’
and the London Records give us again a ‘John le
Mazerer.’ Besides these we have ‘Mazelyn,’ ‘Maselyn,’
and ‘Mazarin,’ probably sign-names, the latter familiarised
to us in the celebrated Cardinal of that name.
Strange to say, ‘Maslin’ and ‘Masser,’ or ‘Macer,’
all rare, are now the only relics we possess of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>once well-known surname and occupation. No instance
I can furnish more clearly demonstrates the uncertainty
of descent in our personal nomenclature. Such
a name as ‘Geoffrey le Hanaper’ or ‘William Hampermaker’
bequeaths us a strange story of changed
circumstance. The shorter appellation, common
enough at this time, still lives in our ‘Hampers.’
While the macer was invariably of maple, the ‘hanap,’
or two-handed goblet, might be of wood or metal.
From the fact of a ‘hanaper,’ Latinized in our
archives into ‘hanaperium,’ being the crate where
these hanaps were kept, it acquired a secondary sense
of a repository for things of a more general character.
Thus has arisen the ‘Hanaper Office’<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c009'><sup>[396]</sup></a> in Chancery,
where writs were treasured up in a basket; and thus
also it is that we now talk of a ‘hamper,’ a term so
delightfully familiar to schoolboys about Christmas
time. Our common ‘Bowlers’ represent such olden
personages as ‘Robert le Bollere’ or ‘Adam le
Boloure,’ they who made the cheap wooden ‘bowl’
or ‘boll.’ The old spelling still survives botanically
in such a phrase as we find in the Authorized Version,
where it speaks of the ‘flax being bolled,’ that is, the
seed vessel was forming. It is always so spelt with
our mediæval writers. Thus Glutton, in the ‘Plowman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>Vision,’ after sleeping away his last drunken
bout, wakes, and—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The firste worde that he warpe</div>
      <div class='line'>Was, ‘Were is the bolle?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘William le Cuppere’ and ‘Richard le Kuppere,’
while engaged in the same occupation, are, speaking
surnominally, absorbed, I doubt not, by our ‘Coopers’
and ‘Cowpers.’ ‘Copper’ may be but another antique
form of the same. Langland speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Coupes of clere gold</div>
      <div class='line'>And coppes of silver.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I shall have occasion almost immediately to mention
Chaucer, as speaking of ‘turning cups,’ which would
seem to infer that they too were often made of wood.</p>
<p class='c007'>Another name once existing was that of ‘Doubler,’
a maker or seller of the ‘doubler’ or ‘dobeler,’ or
dish; a term derived from the French ‘doublier.’
The word is still in use in the North of England,<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c009'><sup>[397]</sup></a> and
both ‘Doubler’ and ‘Doubleman’ are in our directories
of to-day. The name of ‘Scutelaire’ must be set
here also, though when we think of our modern coalscuttle
we might imagine it somewhat of an interloper.
A change, however, has come over the stricter meaning
of the word. A ‘scutel’ was formerly nothing
more nor less than a wooden or metallic dish or platter
used on our early dressoirs for culinary purposes. It
seems ever to have had its place in the dining-hall, for
in the household expenses of Bishop Swinfield (Camden
Soc.) we find the entry, ‘xv. scutellis, xvii.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>salsariis.’ The learned editor of this book, commenting
upon this passage, says, ‘“scutella” is a word
of somewhat extensive application to dishes or platters,
saucers or salvers, and it is retained in our present
English “scuttle.”’ I doubt not with him that while
‘scutum,’ a shield, is the root, the term is here intended
to refer to the large flat spoons or plates used
for the sauce-dishes. It is from his resemblance to
these that some wide-mouthed country bumpkin is
set down in the Hundred Rolls as ‘Arnold Scutelmuth,’
while the occupation of making them finds its
memorial in the Rolls of Parliament in such a
sobriquet as ‘James le Scutelaire.’ Speaking, however,
of the dining table, we may here mention the
cutler. Of such a name as ‘Henry Knyfesmythe’ I
have already had occasion to hint. The cutler enjoyed,
or perhaps I ought to say was the victim of, a very
uncertain orthography in mediæval times, and some of
the forms found are extremely curious. I may cite
such personages as ‘Richard le Cutyler,’ ‘John le
Cotiler,’ ‘Peter le Cotyler,’ ‘Henry le Coteler,’ or
‘Solomon le Cotiller’ as representative of those which
were then most in vogue. All are now content, it would
seem, to be absorbed in the simple ‘Cutler.’ Strange
to say, I cannot find a single ancestor of our familiar
‘Spooner.’ A mediæval rhymester, however, speaks of
‘sponers, turners, and hatters.’ With many of these
names I have just mentioned the ironmonger would
have much to do. The uncertain form of the term
used for this material gave rise to three familiar words,
those of ‘iron,’ ‘ise,’ or ‘ire.’ Trevisa speaks of England
as being plenteous in ‘veynes of metayls, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>bras, of yre, of leed, of tyn, of selver.’<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c009'><sup>[398]</sup></a> Thus while
‘Henry le Ironmonger’ dealt, as no one of my readers
will doubt, in vessels and utensils of the material his
name suggests, it is not to be supposed that ‘Geoffrey
le Iremonger’ or ‘William le Irremongere’ was but a
cant nickname for one of splenetic temperament; or
that in ‘Isabel le Isemonger’ or ‘Agnes la Ismongere’
we have traces of any disposition for those frozen
creams which in the hot summer time we of the nineteenth
century are so glad to seek on the confectioner’s
counter. All alike were hardware manufacturers.
The present forms are ‘Iremonger,’ ‘Irmonger,’ and
‘Ironmonger.’</p>

<p class='c007'>It may seem strange that wood should hold such
a conspicuous position in work of a culinary nature,
but it is with good reason. We must remember all
our ornamental fictile vessels were unknown to our
forefathers. It was not till the close of the sixteenth
century they came into any settled use. It is to this
circumstance we must doubtless refer the extraordinary
prevalence of our ‘Turners.’ Not the least important
articles of their workmanship would be the vessels
they turned off from the lathe. That Jack-of-all-trades,
the Miller of Trumpington, could, according
to Chaucer, amongst his many other achievements,
‘turn cuppes.’<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c009'><sup>[399]</sup></a> When wood, however, was not used,
the utensils were of the roughest character—mugs,
jars, and such like vessels, formed of the common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>baked and glazed clay, and reserved for the ruder
requirements of the household. Our ‘Stephen le
Crockers’ and ‘John le Crokers’ (P. W.)—for both
forms then as now are found—made simply the glazed
crock, or ‘crouke,’ as Chaucer has it, used for holding
butter or milk or such like store—vessels, in fact, reserved
for the scullery or the pantry rather than the
parlour or hall. John de Trevisa, writing in 1387,
says in his description of Britain: ‘There is also
white clay, and red for to make of crokkes, and
steenes (stone jars) and other vessels.’ The same may
be said of our ‘Jarmans.’ Most of our domestic utensils,
therefore, if not of wood or clay, were made of metal,
and this generally of a mixed kind. ‘Henry le Brasour’
or ‘Robert le Brazur,’ now ‘Brazier’ or ‘Brasher,’ worked
in brass; ‘Thomas le Latoner,’ or ‘William le Latoner,’
in latten or bronze;<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c009'><sup>[400]</sup></a> while a mixture of lead and tin
fully employed the wits and hands of our ‘Pewters,’
‘Pewtrers,’ and ‘Founders.’<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c009'><sup>[401]</sup></a> We must not suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>therefore, that ‘John le Discher’ or ‘Robert le
Disshere’ (with their once feminine partner, ‘Margaret
la Disheress’), and ‘Ranulf le Poter’ or ‘Adam le
Potter’ or ‘Thomas Potman,’<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c009'><sup>[402]</sup></a> laboured after the
modern style. The ‘disher’ all but invariably worked
in pewter,<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c009'><sup>[403]</sup></a> and the ‘potter,’ if not in the same, could
only resort to common clay as an alternative.
‘Calisher’ is probably the old ‘le Calicer’ or ‘Chalicer.’
The more modern spelling is found in the
London Records, in 1310, where mention is made of
‘Ralph de Chichestre, Chalicer.’ The ‘chalice’ has
now, however, allied itself so entirely with the sacramental
office of our Church that it is hard to regard
it in the light of an ordinary utensil. As a trade-sign
a chalice would be readily conspicuous, and to this
we owe, no doubt, our ‘Challis’s’ and ‘Challices.’</p>

<p class='c007'>While speaking, however, of drinking vessels, I
must perforce allude to the horner. I need not remind
my reader how many are the descendants of such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>man as ‘Richard le Horner’ or ‘John le Horner,’ but
it may not equally have struck him how all-important
would be his trade at such a period as this. That his
chief manufacture was that of the musical horn I
cannot doubt, so used as it was officially or ordinarily,
at fair and festival, at dance and revelry, in time of
peace and in time of war. The ‘Promptorium Parvulorum’
describes it as ‘hornare, or horne-maker.’
Still this would not be all—far from it. Windows
were commonly made of this material, frames were
constructed of it, the child’s horn-book being but a
memory of this; lanterns were formed of it, cups of
all sizes were fashioned from it, chessmen were manufactured
out of it. In the ‘Franklin’s Tale’ descriptive
of Winter it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Janus sits by the fire with double berd,</div>
      <div class='line'>And drinketh of his bugle-horn the wine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>As a sign-name ‘at the horn’ would be a common
expression, and certainly we have had plenty of
‘Horns,’ if not the ‘horn of plenty,’ at all times
during the last six hundred years.</p>
<p class='c007'>Turning for a moment to vessels of a more general
character, our ‘Coopers’ or ‘Cowpers’<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c009'><sup>[404]</sup></a> or ‘Coupers’
have ever flourished extensively. Such forms as
‘Thomas le Cuper,’ ‘Warin le Couper,’ or ‘Richard le
Cupare’ are found on every side; while even such
entries as ‘Richard Cowpeman’ or ‘Roger Cowperese’
may be occasionally alighted upon. The term ‘coop’
is not in itself in common use now—indeed, saving in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>composition, as in <i>hencoop</i>, for instance, it is all but
obsolete. The Norman and more correct ‘cuve’ gave
us such early names as ‘Ralph le Cuver’ or ‘John le
Cover,’ or ‘Adam le Covreur’ or ‘Robert le Coverur,’
the latter being one more example of a reduplicated
termination.<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c009'><sup>[405]</sup></a> Our modern ‘Covers,’ however, preserve
the earlier and more simple form. Our ‘Cadmans,’
once written ‘Cademans,’ framed the cade or
barrel, the sign-name of which gave us the notorious
Jack Cade of early insurrectionary times. Shakespeare
facetiously suggests a different origin when he
makes Dick the butcher to insinuate that it was for—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Stealing a cade of herring.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In either case the same word is used, and the derivation
in no way impeached. Our ‘Barrells’ are either
sign-names also, or but corruptions of such an old
entry as ‘Stephen le Bariller.’ ‘Alexander le Hopere’
and ‘Andrew le Hopere,’ now ‘Hooper,’ explain
themselves.<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c009'><sup>[406]</sup></a> Doubtless they would be busy enough
at this time in strengthening these several barrels,
cuves, coops, and cades with pliant bands, whether of
wood or metal. Speaking, however, of wooden bands,
reminds us of our ‘Leapers,’ ‘Leapmans,’ and ‘Lipmans.’
A ‘leap’ was a basket of flexible, but strong,
materials, its occurrence in our old writers being so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>frequent as to need no example.<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c009'><sup>[407]</sup></a> The ‘maund’ was
similar in character, but made of more pliant bands,
probably of rushes, for we find it in common use by
our early fishermen. Our ‘Maunders’ and ‘Manders’
are, I think, to be set here, therefore, either as manufacturers
or as wayside beggars, who bore them as
the receptacles of the doles they got. Another supposition
is that they were beggars who acquired the
sobriquet because they maundered out their petition
for alms. I cannot but think the former is the more
likely derivation, our Maundy Thursday itself having
got its name from the practice of doling out the gifts
for the poor from the basket then so named.</p>

<p class='c007'>But we have not even yet completed our list of
surnames derivable from manufactures of this class.
Our ‘Coffers’ represent seemingly the same word in
a twofold capacity. We find occasional records where
the cofferer was undoubtedly an official servant, a
treasurer, one who carried the money of his lord in
his journeys up and down.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c009'><sup>[408]</sup></a> More often, however, he
was a tradesman, a maker or dealer in coffers or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>coffins, the two words being once used altogether
indiscriminately.<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c009'><sup>[409]</sup></a> Many of my readers who are
familiar with Greek will recognise the more literal
translation and meaning of the word in Wicklyffe’s
rendering of Mark vi. 43. ‘And they token the
relyves of broken mete, twelve coffyns full.’ Lacking
any other name to represent the undertaker’s business,
I doubt not our early ‘William le Cofferers’ and
‘Godfrey le Coffrers’ were quite able and willing to
furnish forth this portion of the funeral outfit. These
early surnames, then, must be set beside our already
explained ‘Arkwrights,’ while, as sign-names, our ‘Coffins’
and ‘Coffers’ (supposing the latter not to be a
curter form of ‘Coffrer’) will be as readily recognisable.</p>

<p class='c007'>While, however, wood, clay, and the various
cheaper metals were thus brought into requisition to
provide the utensils of the household and the means
of carriage, we must not forget that leather, too, had
its uses in these respects. It is this lets us into the
secret of the numerosity of our ‘Butlers.’ Important
as undoubtedly was the ‘Boteler’ to the feudal residence,
that fact alone would scarcely account for the
large number of ‘le Botillers’ or ‘le Botelers’ we find
in every considerable roll. The fact is, the name was
both official and occupative. Of this there can be no
doubt. In the York Pageant of 1415 we find walking
in procession together with the ‘Pouchmakers’
the ‘Botillers’ and the ‘Cap-makers,’ all obviously
engaged in the leather manufacture. The phrase
‘like finding a needle in a bottle of hay’ still preserves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>the idea of a bottle as understood by our forefathers
four hundred years ago—that of a leathern case,
whether for holding liquid or solids.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c009'><sup>[410]</sup></a> The hay-bottle
was doubtless the bag that hung at the girth, from
which, as is still the case, the driver baited his horse.
Bottles for liquids were commonly of leather. The
‘black-jack’ was always such. It is of this an old
ballad sings—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then when this bottle doth grow old,</div>
      <div class='line'>And will no longer good liquor hold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Out of its side you may take a clout,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will mend your shoes when they are worn out.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus we see that the ‘Botiller’ was, after all, in some
cases but identical with the old pouch-maker, represented
in our old rolls by such folk as ‘Henry
Poucher’ or ‘Agnes Pouchmaker.’ Another and
more Norman term for this latter was that of ‘Burser’
or ‘Purser,’ though in later days both forms have
come to occupy a more official position. Such names
as ‘Alard le Burser’ or ‘Robert le Pursere’ are of
frequent occurrence. Nor, again, while speaking of
leather, can we omit a reference to the old ‘Henry
Male-maker,’ who made up travelling bags. ‘Cocke
Lorelle’ mentions—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Masones, male-makers, and merbelers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tylers, brycke-leyers, and harde-hewers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The modern postal <i>mail</i> has but extended its earlier
use. We may remember in the ‘Canterbury Tales’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>so pleased were the company at the end of the first
story, that the host said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>Unbuckled is the male,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let see now who shall tell another tale,</div>
      <div class='line'>For trewely this game is wel begun.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We must not forget, however, that many of these
baskets and boxes would require cordage then as
now. Piers Plowman mentions ‘Robyn the Ropere,’
and both name and occupation are still familiar
amongst us. In the Fabric Roll of York Minster is
mentioned a ‘William Raper,’ 1446; and again in
1457, under the head of ‘Custos canabi,’ one ‘Thomas
Kylwake, rapor.’ Both forms are equally common in
our directories. As representative of the more technical
part of the industry we may cite ‘Thomas le
Winder’ and ‘Richard le Windere,’ whose progeny
still dwell among us. ‘Adam le Corder’ or ‘Peter le
Corder,’ or ‘George le Stringer’ or ‘Thomas Strengfellowe,’
carry us back to names of the commonest
import in the fourteenth century. The—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lanterners, stryngers, and grynders</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>are set together by an old rhymer. But I have
already said something about them in connection
with our ‘Bowyers’ and ‘Fletchers,’ so I will pass on.</p>
<p class='c007'>There are but few traces in our nomenclature of
more delicate workmanship. Much of our jewellery
came from abroad. Most of that fashioned in England
was under the skilled eye of the Jew. Still
‘Robert le Goldbeter’ or ‘Henry le Goldsmith’ is
not an uncommon entry at this time. The Norman
equivalent was met by such a name as ‘Roger le
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>Orfevre’ or ‘Peter le Orfeure,’ and these lingered on
in a more or less full form till the seventeenth century.
Their memorial, too, still survives in our
‘Offers’ and ‘Offors.’<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c009'><sup>[411]</sup></a> Ivory was much used, too, and
our ‘Turners’ here also were doubtless very busy. A
pretty little casket of this material, called a ‘forcer,’
small and delicately carved, used in general for storing
away jewellery and other precious gems, was
decidedly popular among the richer ranks of the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In an old poem,
sometimes set down to Chaucer, it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Fortune by strength the forcer hath unshete,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherein was sperde all my worldly richesse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our present ‘Forcers’ and early ‘Nicholas le Forcers’
and ‘Henry le Forcers’ represent this. Our use of
ivory tablets is not yet obsolete, though of late years
the wondrous cheapness of paper and the issue of
pocketbooks and annuals have threatened to absorb
their existence. Of somewhat larger size were the
‘tables’ of this time. Chaucer, in portraying the
Limitour, speaks of him as followed by an attendant,
bearing—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A pair of tables all of ivory,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a pointel, ypolished fetisly,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wrote alway the names, as he stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of alle folk that gave them any good.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is in a yet larger sense of this same word our early
translators introduced the phrase ‘tables of stone,’
found in the Mosaic record—not, however, that the
smaller ‘tablet’ was unknown. Apart from such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>registration as ‘Bartholomew le Tabler,’ found in the
London Rolls (1320), we have mentioned as living in
Cambridge in 1322 one ‘Richard le Tableter.’<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c009'><sup>[412]</sup></a> We
can readily understand how useful would be his occupation
to the students, who were thus provided with
a writing material capable of erasure, at a time when
paper was infinitely too expensive to be simply
scribbled upon.<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c009'><sup>[413]</sup></a> The pointel, or pencil, mentioned
above, seems to have required also a separate manufacture,
as we find the surnames ‘Roger Poyntel’ and
‘John Poyntel’ occurring in 1315 and 1319, the latter
the same date within a year as the ‘Tabler’ just referred
to. These tablets, I need not say, were, whether
the framework were ivory, or box, or cyprus,
overlaid with smeared wax, the pointel being, as its
name more literally implies, the stile with which the
characters were impressed. The pointel was a common
ornament and hung pendent from the neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two surnames far from being uninteresting must
be mentioned here. They are those of ‘Walter
Orlogyr’<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c009'><sup>[414]</sup></a> and ‘Thomas Clokmaker,’ the one being
found in the ‘Guild of St. George, Norwich’ (1385),
the other in the ‘Proceedings and Ordinances of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>Privy Council.’<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c009'><sup>[415]</sup></a> It is just possible also that ‘Clerkwright,’
set down in the former record, may be but a
misspelling or misreading for ‘Clockwright.’ The
two first-mentioned names remind us that if not of
clocks, as now understood, yet the manufacture of
dials did make a transient mark upon our English
nomenclature. I say transient, for I find no trace of
either being handed down even to the second generation
by those who took these sobriquets. The
‘horologe’ seems to have become a pretty familiar
term in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, for we
find Wicklyffe translating 2 Kings xx. 11, ‘Isaye the
profete clepide ynwardly the Lord, and browgte agen
bacward by x degrees the schadewe bi lynes, bi
whiche it hadde gone down thanne in the orologie of
Achaz.’ The transition from clocks to bells is not
a great one, as both have to do with the marking of
time. I will here therefore refer to the old bellfounder,
and then pass on. The ‘Promptorium
Parvulorum’ gives us ‘Bellezeter’ as the then usual
term for the trade, and from the occurrence of such
entries as ‘Robert le Belzetere’ or ‘William le Belzetere’
we cannot doubt but that it was so. Of course
a corruption of so awkward a word was inevitable,
and Stow, by informing us that ‘Billiter Lane’ was
formerly nothing more nor less than ‘Belzetars Lane,’
has prevented dispute from arising regarding the
origin of our ‘Billiters.’<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c009'><sup>[416]</sup></a> If, however, further proof
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>were necessary, we could bring forward ‘Esmon Belleyeter’
from the Privy Council Ordinances.<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c009'><sup>[417]</sup></a> Stripped
of its uncouth orthography, we are here shown the
process by which the changed pronunciation gradually
came into use.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must say a word or two about former coinage,
and weights and measures, for all are more or less
carefully memorialized in our directories of to-day.
The two chief names, however, by which the early
scale was represented, ‘le Aunserer’ and ‘le Balancer,’
are, I am sorry to say, either wholly, or all but wholly,
extinct. Such entries as ‘Rauf le Balancer’<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c009'><sup>[418]</sup></a> or ‘John
Balauncer’ or ‘Thomas le Aunseremaker’ were perfectly
familiar with our forefathers. The ‘balance’
was of the simplest character, a scale poised by the
hand. The manufacture of such is mentioned by the
author of ‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote,’ when he includes—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Arowe-heders, maltemen, and cornemongers,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Balancers</i>, tynne-casters, and skryveners.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>By its repeated occurrence in our present Authorized
Version this word is sure of preservation from
obsoletism. The ‘auncel’ or ‘auncer’ was strictly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>the vessel in which the provisions were weighed. Piers
Plowman says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And the pound that she paied by</div>
      <div class='line'>Peised a quatron moore</div>
      <div class='line'>Than myn owene auncer.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In an appraisement of goods in 1356 mention is made,
among other chattels, of ‘one balance called an
auncer.’<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c009'><sup>[419]</sup></a> Thus our somewhat rare ‘Ansers’ are
not such <i>geese</i> as they look! Our modern notion of
the Mint is that of a place where with a certain amount
of State secrecy our money is coined and sent forth.
Nothing of this kind existed formerly: each considerable
town had its own mint, and even barons and
bishops, subject to royal superintendence, could issue
coin. Thus it is that we meet with more or less
frequency such a name as ‘Nicholas le Cuner,’ from
the old ‘cune’ or ‘coin;’ or ‘John le Meneter,’ or
‘John Monemakere,’ or ‘William le Moneur,’ or
‘William le Mynsmith,’ mint-smith, that is; and thus
it is our present ‘Moniers’ or ‘Moneyers’ and ‘Minters’
have arisen. Our ‘Stampers’ remind us of the
chief feature of coinage, the die. The system being
thus general, and subject to but an uncertain and
irregular supervision, abuse of alloy crept in, and it
was to remedy this, it is said, our ‘Testers’ and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>‘Sayers,’ corrupted from assayers, were appointed.
‘Sayer’ or ‘Sayers,’ however, I have elsewhere derived
differently, and in most cases I feel confident the
account there given is more approximate to the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Literature and art in regard to the market are not
without their relics. So far as the outside of books
was concerned, our former ‘John le Bokbinders’ or
‘Dionisia le Bokebynders’ are sufficiently explicit.
These, judging from their date, we must suppose to
have bound together leathern documents and parchments
of value, or books of manuscript. Speaking
of parchment, however, we are reminded of the importance
of this for testamentary and other legal
purposes. Thus we find such names as ‘Stephen le
Parchemyner’ or ‘William le Parchemynere’ to be
common at this time. They afford but one more
instance of an important and familiar name failing of
descent. In the York Pageant, mentioned elsewhere,
the ‘Parchemyners’<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c009'><sup>[420]</sup></a> and ‘Bukbynders’ marched
together.<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c009'><sup>[421]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The old sealmaker, an important tradesman in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>day when men were much better known by their
crests than now, left its mark in the early ‘Seler.’ In
the ‘Issues of the Exchequer’ we find a certain
‘Hugh le Seler’ commissioned to make a new seal
for the See of Durham. The modern form is ‘Sealer.’
Professional writers and copiers were common. The
calling of scribe has given us our many ‘Scrivens’
and ‘Scriveners,’ descendants of the numerous
‘William le Scrivayns’ and ‘John le Scrivryns’ of our
mediæval rolls. Piers Plowman employs the word—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I wel noght scorne, quoth Scripture,</div>
      <div class='line'>But if scryveynes lye.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Writers’ are but the Saxon form of the same,
while ‘le Cirograffer’ would seem to represent the
Greek. A ‘William le Cirograffer’ occurs in the
Hundred Rolls. As a writer of indentures he is
frequently mentioned. An act passed in the first
year of Edward IV. speaks of such officers as ‘clerk
of our council, clerk or keeper of oure Hanaper, office
of cirograffer, and keeper of oure Wills.’<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c009'><sup>[422]</sup></a> Employed
in the skilled art of text-letter we may next mention
such men as ‘Godfrey le Lomynour’ or ‘Ralph Illuminator’
or ‘Thomas Liminer.’ A poem, already
quoted more than once, makes reference to—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Parchemente makers, skynners, and plowers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Barbers, Boke-bynders, and lyminers.<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c009'><sup>[423]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>How beautiful were the decorations and devices upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>which they spent their care, some of the missals and
other service books of this early period show.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c009'><sup>[424]</sup></a> This,
I need scarcely add, was a favourite monastic pursuit.
I do not know that ‘Limner’ still exists as a surname,
unless it be in our ‘Limmers.’ That it lingered on
in its more correct form till the beginning of the
eighteenth century is certain, as the Tostock register
serves to show, for it is there recorded that ‘John
Limner of Chevington, and Eliz. Sibbes of this town,
were married, August 22nd, 1700.’ (Sibbes’ ‘Works,’
vol. i. p. cxlii.)</p>
<p class='c007'>Before closing this necessarily hurried résumé of
mediæval trade, we must say a word or two about
early shipping. We have mentioned certain articles,
especially those of spicery and wines, which were then
used, as the result of foreign merchant enterprise.
Much of all this came as the growth and produce of
the opposite Continent. Much again reached our
shore brought hither from Eastern lands in caravan
and caravel by Venetian traders. Our ‘Marchants,’
‘Merchants,’ or ‘le Marchants,’ we doubtless owe to
this more extended commerce. Apart from these,
however, we are far from being without names of a
more seafaring nature. It is a strange circumstance
that our now one general term of ‘sailor’ had in the
days we are considering but the barest existence surnominally
or colloquially. In the former respect I
only find it twice, the instances being those of ‘John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>le Saillur’ and ‘Nicholas le Saler,’ both to be found
in the Hundred Rolls. It may be said to be a word
of entirely modern growth. The expression then in
familiar use was ‘Shipman,’<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c009'><sup>[425]</sup></a> and ‘Shipman’ is the
surname best represented in our nomenclature. It is
by this name one of Chaucer’s company at the
Tabard is pictured forth—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A Shipman ther was woned far by West,</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew wel alle the havens as they were,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fro’ Gotland to the Cape de Finisterre,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every creke, in Bretagne, and in Spaine;</div>
      <div class='line'>His barge ycliped was the ‘Magdelaine.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This, intended doubtless to set forth the wide extent
of his adventure, would seem cramped enough for the
seafarer of the nineteenth century. The word itself
lingered on for some length of time, being found both
in our Homilies and in the Authorized Version, but
seems to have declined towards the end of the seventeenth
century. ‘Henry le Mariner’s’ name still lives
among us, sometimes being found in the abbreviated
form of ‘Marner,’ and ‘Shipper’ or ‘Skipper’ is not
as yet obsolete. The strictly speaking feminine
‘Shipster’ comes in the quaint old poem of ‘Cocke
Lorelle’s Bote,’ where mention is made among others
of—</p>

<p class='c017'>‘Cogger,’ found in such an entry as ‘Hamond le
Cogger’ or ‘Henry le Cogger,’ carries us back to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>old ‘cogge’ or fishing smack, a term very familiar on
the east coast, and one not yet altogether obsolete.
It seems to have been often used to carry the soldiery
across the Channel to France and the Low Country
border, or even further.<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c009'><sup>[426]</sup></a> Our <i>cockswain</i> was, I doubt
not, he who attended to the tiller of the boat. We
still speak also of a <i>cock-boat</i>, written in the ‘Promptorium
Parvulorum’ as ‘cog bote,’ and doubtless it
was originally some smaller craft that waited upon
and attended the other. Thus it is highly probable
that ‘le Cockere’ may in some instances have been
but equivalent to ‘le Cogger.’<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c009'><sup>[427]</sup></a> ‘Richard le Botsweyn,’
‘Edward Botswine,’ ‘Peter Boatman,’ ‘Jacob
Boatman,’ or the more local ‘Gerard de la Barge,’
are all still familiar enough in an occupative sense,
but surnominally have been long extinct, with the
exception of the last.<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c009'><sup>[428]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Coming to port, whether it were York, or Kingston,
or Chester, or London, we find ‘Adam le
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>Waterman,’ or ‘Richard Waterbearer,’ or ‘William le
Water-leder’ busy enough by the waterside.<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c009'><sup>[429]</sup></a> The
latter term, however, was far the commonest in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. I have already
mentioned the sense of ‘lead’ at this time, that of
carrying. Piers Plowman, to quote but one more
instance, says in one place—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>With Lumbardes letters</div>

</div>

<p class='c017'>In the York Pageant of 1415 we find two separate
detachments of these water-leaders in procession, one
in conjunction with the bakers, the other with the
cooks. It would be doubtless these two classes of
shopkeepers their duties of carrying stores, especially
flour, to and from the different vessels would bring
them in contact with most. Our ‘Leaders,’ ‘Leeders,’
‘Leders,’ and ‘Loders’ are either the more general
carrier or an abbreviated form of the above.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c009'><sup>[430]</sup></a> ‘Gager,’
though rarely met with now, is a descendant of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>‘William le Gageour,’ or ‘Alexander le Gauger,’ or
‘Henry le Gaugeour,’ of many a mediæval record.
His office was to attend to the King’s revenue at our
seaports, and though not strictly so confined, yet his
duties were all but entirely concerned in the measurement
of liquids, such as oil, wine, honey.<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c009'><sup>[431]</sup></a> The tun,
the pipe, the tierce, the puncheon, casks and barrels
of a specified size—these came under his immediate
supervision, and the royal fee was accordingly. Such
a name as ‘Josceus le Peisur,’ now found as ‘Poyser’
or ‘Henry le Waiur,’ that is, ‘Weigher,’<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c009'><sup>[432]</sup></a> met with
now also in the form of ‘Weightman,’ represented
the passage of more solid merchandise. The old
form of ‘poise’ was ‘peise.’ Piers Plowman makes
Covetousness to confess—</p>

<p class='c017'>With the above, therefore, we must associate our
‘Tollers,’ once registered as ‘Bartholomew le Tollere’
or ‘Ralph le Toller,’ together with our ‘Tolemans’
and ‘Tolmans,’ they who took the King’s levy at fair
and market—by the roadside and the wharf.<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c009'><sup>[433]</sup></a> Piers

<p class='c018'>In concluding this chapter, and our survey of trade
generally, it will be necessary to the completion
thereof that we should say a word or two about the
money trading of four hundred years ago or more.
Banks, bank-notes, bills of exchange, drafts to order—all
these are as familiar to the tongues of the nineteenth
century as if the great car of commerce had
ever gone along on such greased and comfortable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>wheels. But I need not say it is not so. Very little
money in the present day is practically coin. Our
banks have it all. It was different with our ancestors.
As a rule it was stored up in some secret cupboard
or chest. Hence it is, as I have shown, the trade of
‘le Coffer’ and the office of ‘le Cofferer’ are so much
thrust before our notice in surveying mediæval
records. Still, trading in money was largely carried
on, so far, at any rate, as loans were concerned. The
Jew, true to his national precedents, was then, I need
not say, the pawnbroker of Europe, and as his disciple,
the Lumbard soon bid fair to outstrip his master.
Under the Plantagenet dynasty both found a prosperous
field for their peculiar business in England,
and, as I have elsewhere said, Lombard Street<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c009'><sup>[435]</sup></a> to this
day is a memorial of the settlement of the latter. In
such uncertain and changeful times as these, kings,
and in their train courtiers and nobles, soon learnt
the art, not difficult in initiation, of pawning jewels
and lands for coin. The Malvern Dreamer speaks
familiarly of this—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I have lent lordes</div>
      <div class='line'>And ladies my chaffare,</div>
      <div class='line'>And been their brocour after,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bought it myselve;</div>
      <div class='line'>Eschaunges and chevysaunces</div>
      <div class='line'>With such cheffare I dele.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This species of commerce is early marked by such
names as ‘Henry le Chaunger’ or ‘Adam le Chevestier,’<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c009'><sup>[436]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>while still better-known terms are brought to
our notice by entries like ‘John le Banckere,’ ‘Roger
le Bencher,’ ‘Thomas le Brokur,’ or ‘Simon le Brokour.’
Holinshed, in the form of ‘brogger,’ has the latter to
denote one who negotiated for coin. As ‘Broggers,’
too, we met them in the York Pageant. There,
probably, they would transact much of the business
carried on between ourselves and the Dutch in the
shipping off of fleeces, or the introduction of the
cloth again from the Flemish manufacturers.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c009'><sup>[437]</sup></a> The
pawnbroker of modern days, dealing in petty articles
of ware, was evidently an unknown personage at the
date we are considering. The first distinctive notice of
him I can light upon is in the ‘Statutes of the Realm’
of the Stuart period. It will be there found that
(chapter xxi.) James I., speaking of the change from
the old broker into the more modern pawnbroker,
refers to the former as one who went ‘betweene
Merchant Englishe and Merchant Strangers, and
Tradesmen in the contrivinge, makinge and concluding
Bargaines and Contractes to be made betweene them
concerning their wares and merchandises,’ and then
adds that he ‘never of any ancient tyme used to buy
and sell garments, household stuffe, or to take pawnes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>and bills of sale of garments and apparele, and all
things that come to hand for money, laide out and
lent upon usury, or to keepe open shoppes, and to
make open shewes, and open trade, as now of late
yeeres hathe and is used by a number of citizens, etc.’</p>

<hr class='c022' />
<h3 class='c020'><span class='sc'>Appendix to Chapters IV. and V.</span></h3>
<p class='c017'>It will perchance help to familiarize the reader with
the manner in which the occupative names contained
in the two preceding chapters arose, if I transcribe
several lists of tradesmen which have come across my
notice while engaged in the work of collecting surnames
for my index. The first is found in most of
the Yorkshire County Histories, and is a record of the
order of the Pageant for the City of York in 1415.
The second is the order of the Procession of the
Craftsmen and Companies of Norwich from the Common
Hall in 1533. This list will be found in Blomefield’s
‘Norfolk,’ vol. ii. p. 148. The third is the order
of the Chester Play, inaugurated 1339, and discontinued
1574. This list will be found in Ormerod’s
‘Cheshire,’ vol. i. p. 300. These records possess an
intrinsic value, apart from other matters, as proving
to the reader the leading position which these several
cities held as centres of industry in the thirteenth,
fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. The
last list I would furnish is that met with in the quaint
poem entitled ‘Cocke Lorelle’s Bote,’ published about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>the beginning of the reign of Henry VIII., and purporting
to give a list of the tradesmen and manufacturers
of the metropolis at that time. I have quoted
merely the portion that concerns my purpose, and it
is taken from the edition published by the Percy
Society. Though not perfect, that edition is undoubtedly
the best.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />‘<span class='sc'>Nicknames.</span>’</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>If we may trust the accredited origin of the term
nickname—viz., that it is prosthetically put for ‘an
ekename,’ that is, an added name—it may seem somewhat
inconsistent to entitle a special branch of my
book by that which in reality embraces the whole.
But I do not think I shall be misunderstood, since,
whatever be the original meaning intended, the word
has now so thoroughly settled down into its present
sphere of verbal usefulness that it would be a matter
of still more lengthened explanation if I were to put
it in its more pretentious and literal sense. By
‘nickname,’ in this chapter, at any rate, I intend to
take in all those fortuitous and accidental sobriquets
which, once expressive of peculiar and individual
characteristics, have survived the age in which they
sprang, and now preserved only in the lumber-room
of our directories, may be brought forth once more
wherever they help to throw a brighter light upon the
decayed memorials of a bygone era. It will be seen
at a glance that it is no easy task that of assorting a
large body of nondescript and unclassed terms, but I
will do my best under pleaded indulgence.</p>
<p class='c007'>We are not without traces of this special kind of
sobriquets even in the early days before the Norman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>Conquest was dreamt or thought of. I have already
instanced the Venerable Bede as speaking of two
missionaries who, both bearing the name of Hewald,
were distinguished by the surnames of ‘White’ and
‘Black,’ on account of their hair partaking of those
respective hues. In the ninth century, too, Ethelred,
Earl of the Gaini, was styled the ‘Mucel’ or ‘Mickle’—‘eo
quod erat corpore magnus et prudentiâ grandis.’
With the incoming of the Normans, however, came a
great change. The burlesque was part of their nature.
A vein for the ludicrous was speedily acquired. It
spread in every rank and grade of society. The
Saxon himself was touched with the contagion, ere
yet the southern blood was infused into his veins.
Equally among the high and the low did such sobriquets
as ‘le Bastard,’ ‘le Rouse,’ ‘le Beauclerk,’ ‘le
Grisegonel’ (Greycloke), ‘Plantagenet,’ ‘Sansterre,’
and ‘Cœur de lion’ find favour. But it did not stay
here; the more ridiculous and absurd characteristics
became the butt of attack. In a day when buffoonery
had become a profession, when every roughly-sketched
drawing was a caricature, every story a record of
licentious adventure, it could not be otherwise. The
only wonderment is the tame acquiescence on the
part of the stigmatized bearer. To us now-a-days,
to be termed amongst our fellows ‘Richard the
Crookbacked,’ ‘William Blackinthemouth,’ ‘Thomas
the Pennyfather’ (that is, the Miser), or ‘Thomas
Wrangeservice’ (the opposite of Walter Scott’s
‘Andrew Fairservice’), would be looked upon as
mere wanton insult. But it was then far different.
The times, as I have said, were rougher and coarser,
and the delicacy of feeling which would have shrunk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>from so addressing those with whom we had to deal,
or from making them the object of our banter, would
have been perfectly misunderstood. Apart from this,
too, the bearer, after all, had little to do with the
question. He did not give himself the nickname he
received it; pleasant or unpleasant, as he had no voice
in the acquisition, so had he none in its retention.
There was nothing for it but good-tempered acquiescence.
We know to this very day how difficult was
the task of getting rid of our school nicknames, how
they clung to us from the unhappy hour in which
some sharp-witted, quick, discerning youngster found
out our weak part, and dubbed us by a sobriquet,
which, while it perhaps exaggerated the characteristic
to which it had reference, had the effect which a
hundred admonitions from paternal or magisterial
head-quarters had not, to make us see our folly and
mend our ways. None the less, however, did the affix
remain, and this was our punishment. How often,
when in after years we come accidentally across some
quondam schoolfellow, each staring strangely at the
other’s grizzly beard or beetled brow, the old sobriquet
will crop up to the lips, and in the very naturalness
with which the expression is uttered all the separation
of years of thought and feeling is forgotten, and we
are instantly back to the old days and the old haunts,
and pell-mell in the thick of old boyish scrapes again.
Yet perchance these names were offensive. But they
have wholly lost their force. We had ceased to feel
hurt by them long before we parted in early days.
See how this, too, is illustrated in the present day in
the names of certain sects and parties. We talk
calmly of ‘Capuchins,’ ‘Quakers,’ ‘Ranters,’ ‘Whigs’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>and ‘Tories,’ and yet some of these taken literally
are offensive enough, especially the political ones.
But, as we know, all that attached to them of odium
has long ago become clouded, obscured, and forgotten,
and now they are the accepted, nay, proudly owned,
titles of the party they represent. Were it not for
this we might be puzzled to conceive why in these
early times such a name as ‘le Bonde,’ significant of
nothing but personal servitude and galling oppression,
was allowed to remain. That ‘le Free’ and ‘le Freman’
and ‘le Franch-homme’ should survive the
ravages of time is natural enough. But with ‘Bond’
it is different. It bespoke slavery. Yet it is one of
our most familiar names of to-day. How is this?
The explanation is easy. The term was used to
denote personality, not position; the notion of condition
was lost in that of identity. It was just the same
with sobriquets of a more humorous and broad character,
with nicknames in fact. The roughest humour
of those rough days is oftentimes found in these early
records, and the surnames which, putting complimentary
and objectionable and neutral together, belong to
this day to this class, form still well-nigh the largest
proportion of our national nomenclature. There is
something indescribably odd, when we reflect about it,
that the turn of a toe, the twist of a leg, the length of
a limb, the colour of a lock of hair, a conceited look,
a spiteful glance, a miserly habit of some in other
respects unknown and long-forgotten ancestor, should
still five or six centuries afterwards be unblushingly
proclaimed to the world by the immediate descendants
therefrom. And yet so it is with our ‘Cruickshanks’
or ‘Whiteheads’ or ‘Meeks’ or ‘Proudmans;’ thus it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>is with our ‘Longmans’ and ‘Shortmans,’ our ‘Biggs’
and ‘Littles,’ and the endless others we shall speedily
mention. Still these represent a better class of surnames.
As time wore on, and the nation became
more refined, there was an attempt made, successful
in many instances, to throw off the more objectionable
of these names. Some were so utterly gross and
ribald as even in that day to sink into almost instant
oblivion. Some, I doubt not, never became hereditary
at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>In glancing briefly over a portion of these names
we must endeavour to affect some order. We might
divide them into two classes merely, physical and
moral or mental peculiarities; but this would scarcely
suffice for distinction, as each would still be so large
as to make us feel ourselves to be in a labyrinth that
had no outlet. Nor would these two classes be
sufficiently comprehensive? There would still be left
a large mass of sobriquets which could scarcely be
placed with fitness in either category: nicknames
from Nature, nicknames from oaths, or street-cries, or
mottoes, or nicknames again in the shape of descriptive
compounds. Names from the animal kingdom,
of course, could be set under either a moral or physical
head, as, in all cases, saving when they have
arisen from inn-signs or ensigns, they would be
affixed on the owner for some supposed affinity he
bore in mind or body to the creature in question.
Still it will be easier to place them, as well as some
others, under a third and more miscellaneous category.
These three divisions I would again subdivide
in the following fashion:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>I.—<i>Physical and External Peculiarities.</i></p>

<p class='c026'>(1) Nicknames from peculiarities of relationship,
condition, age, size, shape, and capacity.</p>
<p class='c026'>(2) Nicknames from peculiarities of complexion.</p>
<p class='c026'>(3) Nicknames from peculiarities of dress and its accoutrements.</p>

<p class='c007'>II.—<i>Mental and Moral Peculiarities.</i></p>

<p class='c026'>(1) Nicknames from peculiarities of disposition—<i>complimentary</i>.</p>
<p class='c026'>(2) Nicknames from peculiarities of disposition—<i>objectionable</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>III.—<i>Miscellaneous.</i></p>

<p class='c026'>(1) Nicknames from the animal and vegetable kingdom.</p>
<p class='c026'>(2) Descriptive compounds affixed as nicknames.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c009'><sup>[438]</sup></a></p>
<p class='c026'>(3) Nicknames from oaths, street-cries, and mottoes.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>I.—<span class='sc'>Physical and External Peculiarities.</span></h3>

<h4 class='c027'>(1) <i>Nicknames from Peculiarities of Relationship, Age, Size, and Capacity.</i></h4>
<p class='c018'>(<i>a</i>) <i>Relationship.</i>—There is scarcely any position in
which one man can stand to another which is not found
recorded pure and simple in the surnames of to-day.
The manner in which these arose was natural enough.
We still talk of ‘John Smith, Senior,’ and ‘John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>Smith, Junior,’ when we require a distinction to be
made between two of the same name. So it was then,
only the practice was carried further. I find, for
instance, in one simple record, the following insertions:—‘John
Darcy le fiz,’ ‘John Darcy le frere,’
‘John Darcy le unkle,’ ‘John Darcy le cosyn,’ ‘John
Darcy le nevue,’ and ‘John Darcy, junior.’ How easy
would it be for those in whose immediate community
these different representatives of the one same name
lived to style each by his term of relationship, and
for this, once familiarised, to become his surname.
‘Uncle,’<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c009'><sup>[439]</sup></a> once found as ‘Robert le Unkle,’ or ‘John
le Uncle,’ is now quite obsolete, I think; but the
pretty old Saxon ‘Eame’ abides hale and hearty
in our numberless ‘Eames,’ ‘Ames,’ ‘Emes,’ and
‘Yeames.’ We find it used in the ‘Townley Mysteries.’
In one of them Rebecca tells Jacob he must
flee for fear of Esau—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Jacob.</i>   Wheder-ward shuld I go, dame?</div>
    </div>

      <div class='line in8'>That dwellys beside Jordan streme.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The ‘Promp. Par.’ defines a <i>cozen</i> to be an ‘emys son,’
and it is from him, no doubt, our many ‘Cousens,’
‘Cousins,’ ‘Couzens,’ and ‘Cozens’ have sprung,
descended as they are from ‘Richard le Cusyn’ (A.),
or ‘John le Cosyn’ (G.), or ‘Thomas le Cozun’ (E.).
‘Kinsman’ (‘John Kynnesman,’ Z.Z.) may be of the
same degree. ‘Widowson’ (‘William le Wedweson,’
R., ‘Simon fil. Vidue,’ A.<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c009'><sup>[440]</sup></a>) is apparently the same as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>the once existing ‘Faderless’ (‘John Faderless,’ M.),<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c009'><sup>[441]</sup></a>
while ‘Brotherson’ and ‘Sisterson’ (‘Jacob Systerson,’
W. 3) seem to be but old-fashioned phrases for a
nephew, in which case they are but synonymous with
the Norman ‘Nephew,’ ‘Neve,’ ‘Neave,’ or ‘Neaves;’
all these forms being familiar to our directories, and
descendants of ‘Reyner le Neve’ (A.), or ‘Richard le
Nevu’ (E.), or ‘Robert le Neave’ (Z.). Capgrave,
giving the descent of Eber, says: ‘In this yere (anno
2509) Sala begat Heber; and of this Eber, as auctouris
say, came the people Hebrak, for Heber was
<i>neve</i> unto Sem.’ Thus again, the Saxon ‘Arnold le
Fader’ was met by the Norman ‘John Parent,’ and
the still more foreign ‘Ralph le Padre,’ while ‘William
le Brother’ found his counterpart in ‘Geoffrey le
Freer,’ or ‘Frere;’ but as in so many cases this
latter must be a relic of the old freere or friar, we had
better refer it, perhaps, to that more spiritual relationship.<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c009'><sup>[442]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Condition.</i>—We have still traces in our midst
of sobriquets relating to the poverty or wealth of the
original bearer. Our ‘Poores,’ often found as ‘Powers,’
are descended from the ‘Roger le Poveres,’ or ‘Robert
le Poors,’ of the thirteenth century, while our ‘Riches’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>are set down at the same period as ‘Swanus le Riche’
or ‘Gervase le Riche.’ Of several kindred surnames
we may mention a ‘John le Nedyman,’ now obsolete,
and an ‘Elyas le Diveys,’ which, in the more Biblical
form of Dives, still exists in the metropolis. It is
somewhat remarkable that we should have the Jewish
‘Lazarus’ also, and that this too should have arisen
in not a few instances from the fact that its first
possessor was a leper. ‘Nicholas le Lepere’ and
‘Walter le Lepper’ speak for themselves. With the
above we may ally our early ‘Robert le Ragiddes’ and
‘Thomas le Raggedes,’ which remind us that our
vagabonds, if not our ‘Raggs’ and ‘Raggetts,’ are
of no modern extraction, but come of a very old
family indeed! ‘Half-naked,’ I unhesitatingly at first
set down as one of this class, but it is local.<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c009'><sup>[443]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Age, Size, Shape, Capacity.</i>—This class is very
large, and embraces every possible, and well-nigh impossible
feature of human life. A glance over our old
records, and we can almost at once find ‘Lusty’ and
‘Strong,’ ‘Long’ and ‘Short,’ ‘Bigg’<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c009'><sup>[444]</sup></a> and ‘Little,’
‘High’ and ‘Lowe’ (both perchance local), ‘Large’
and ‘Small,’ ‘Thick’ and ‘Thin,’ ‘Slight’ and ‘Round,’
‘Lean’ and ‘Fatt,’ ‘Megre’ and ‘Stout,’<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c009'><sup>[445]</sup></a> ‘Ould’
and ‘Young,’ and ‘Light’ and ‘Heavy.’ Was this
not sufficient? Were there several in the same
community who could boast similarity in respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>to one or other of these varieties? Then we got
‘Stronger,’ ‘Shorter,’ ‘Younger,’<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c009'><sup>[446]</sup></a> ‘Littler,’ ‘Least,’<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c009'><sup>[447]</sup></a>
‘Senior,’ ‘Junior,’ and in some cases ‘Elder.’ Some
of these are of course Norman; but when Saxon
occur we can all but invariably find the Norman
equivalent. Thus, if ‘Large’ be Saxon, ‘Gros’ (now
‘Grose’ and ‘Gross’) is Norman; if ‘Bigge’ be Saxon,
‘Graunt’ or ‘Grant’ or ‘Grand’ is Norman;<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c009'><sup>[448]</sup></a> if ‘Small’
be Saxon, ‘Pettitt’ or ‘Pettye’ or ‘Petty’ or ‘Peat’
is Norman. Thus again, ‘Lowe’ meets face to face
with ‘Bas’ or ‘Bass,’ ‘Short’ with ‘Curt,’ ‘Fatte’ with
‘Gras’ or ‘Grass’ or ‘Grace,’<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c009'><sup>[449]</sup></a> ‘Strong’ with ‘Fort,’
‘Ould’ with ‘Viele,’ ‘Twist’ with ‘Tort,’ and ‘Young’
or ‘Yonge’ with ‘Jeune.’ Sometimes the termination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>‘<i>man</i>’ is added, as in ‘Strongman,’ ‘Longman,’
‘Smallman,’ ‘Oldman,’ and ‘Youngman,’ or if a
woman, <i>dame</i>, as in such a case as ‘Matilda Lenedame,’
which as a surname died probably with its
owner. Sometimes, again, we have the older and
more antique form, as in ‘Smale’ and ‘Smaleman,’
that is, small; ‘Yonge’ and ‘Yongeman,’ that is, young;
and ‘Lyte’ and ‘Lyteman,’ that is, little; ‘Wight’
and ‘Wightman,’ now obsolete in our general vocabulary,
referred to personal strength and activity. In
the ‘Vision of Piers Plowman,’ one of the sons of
‘Sire Inwit’ is described as being—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A wight man of strength.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Manikin,’ found at the same period, needs no explanation.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c009'><sup>[450]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Of the less general we have well-nigh numberless
illustrations. It is only when we come to look at our
nomenclature we find out how many separate limbs,
joints, and muscles we individually possess, and by
what a variety of terms they severally went in
earlier days. No treatise of anatomy can be more
precise in regard to this than our directories. Some
prominence or other peculiarity about the head or
face has given us our ‘Chins,’ ‘Chekes,’ or ‘Cheeks,’
and ‘Jowles,’ or ‘Joules.’ We are all familiar with
the protruding fangs of our friend ‘Jowler’ of the
canine community. Thus even here also we must
place ‘cheek by jowl.’ ‘Glossycheek’ (‘Bertholomew
Gloscheke,’ A.) once existed, but is obsolete now.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>The same is true in respect of ‘Duredent’ (‘Walter
Duredent,’ E.), or ‘Dent-de-fer,’ <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Irontoothed’
(‘Robert Dent-de-fer,’ E.), which spoke well no doubt
for the masticatory powers of its owner. ‘Merrymouth’
(‘Richard Merymouth,’ X.) would be a standing
testimony to its possessor’s good humour. It is
decidedly more acceptable than ‘Dogmow’<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c009'><sup>[451]</sup></a> (‘Arnulph
Dogmow,’ A.) or ‘Calvesmawe’ (‘Robert Calvesmaghe,’
M.), recorded at the same period. Sweetmouth’
(‘Robert Swetemouth,’ D.) also speaks for the
sentiment of the times. In modern days, at least,
the eye is supposed to be one of the chief points of
personal identity. I only find one or two instances,
however, where this feature has given the sobriquet in
our mediæval rolls. In the ‘Calendarium Genealogicum’
a ‘Robertus Niger-oculus,’ or ‘Robert Blackeye,’
is set down as having been ‘pro felonia suspensus.’
We are reminded in his name of the ‘Blackeyed
Susan’ of later days, but whether Nature had
given him the said hue or some pugilistic encounter
I cannot say. Judging by his antecedents, so far as
the above Latin sentence betrays them, the latter
would seem to be the more likely origin.<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c009'><sup>[452]</sup></a> ‘William
le Blynd,’ or ‘Ralph le Blinde,’ speak for themselves.<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c009'><sup>[453]</sup></a>
The ‘Saxon Head,’ in some cases local, doubtless,
is still familiar to us. Its more Norman ‘Tait’ fitly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>sits at present upon the archiepiscopal throne of
Canterbury. Grostete, one of which name was a distinguished
bishop of Lincoln in the fourteenth century,
is now represented by ‘Greathead’ and ‘Broadhead’
only. Butler, in his ‘Hudibras,’ records it in
the more colloquial form of Grosted—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>None a deeper knowledge boasted,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since Hodge Bacon, and Bob Grosted.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The equally foreign ‘Belteste’ (‘John Beleteste,’ A.)
is content, likewise, to allow ‘Fairhead’ (‘Richard
Faireheved,’ H.) to transmit to posterity the claims
of its early possessor to <i>capital</i> grace. ‘Blackhead’<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c009'><sup>[454]</sup></a>
existed in the seventeenth, and ‘Hardhead’ in the
fifteenth century. These are all preferable, however,
to ‘Lambshead’ (‘Agnes Lambesheved,’ A.), found
some generations earlier, and still firmly settled in
our midst, as the ‘London Directory’ can vouch.<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c009'><sup>[455]</sup></a>
So much for the head. ‘Neck’ and ‘Swire’ are both
synonymous. Chaucer describes Envy as ready to
‘scratch her face,’ or ‘rend her clothes,’ or ‘tear her
swire,’<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c009'><sup>[456]</sup></a> in respect of which latter feat we should now
more generally say ‘tear her hair.’ Either operation,
however, would be unpleasant enough, and it is just
as well that for all practical purposes it only occurs in
poetry. Some characteristic of strength, or beauty, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>deformity (let us assume one of the former) has given
us our ‘Hands,’ ‘Armes,’ and ‘Brass’s,’ from the old
‘Braz.’ ‘Finger,’ once existing (‘Matilda Finger,’ H.),
is now obsolete. Whether this sobriquet was given
on the same grounds as that bestowed on the redoubtable
‘Tom Thumb,’ I cannot say. ‘Brazdifer’
(‘Simon Braz-de-fer,’ E., ‘Michael Bras-de-fer,’ B.B.),
arm of iron, once a renowned nom-de-plume, still
dwells, though obsolete in itself, in our ‘Strongithams’
and ‘Armstrongs.’<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c009'><sup>[457]</sup></a> A common form of this North-country
name was ‘Armstrang’ or ‘Armestrang’
(‘Adam le Armstrang,’ G.), reminding us that our
‘Strangs’ are but the fellows of our more southern
‘Strongs’ (‘John le Strang,’ E., ‘Joscelin le Strong,’
H.). ‘Lang’<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c009'><sup>[458]</sup></a> and ‘Long’ represent a similar difference
of pronunciation. The ‘Armstrongs’ were a
great Border clan. Mr. Lower reminds me of the
following lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ye need not go to Liddisdale,</div>
      <div class='line'>For when they see the blazing bale</div>
      <div class='line'>Elliots and Armstrongs never fail.</div>
      <div class='c021'>(<i>Lay of the Last Minstrel.</i>)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Another and more foreign form of this sobriquet,
‘Ferbas’ (‘Robert Ferbras,’ M.), has come down to us
in our somewhat curious-looking ‘Firebraces.’ Still
earlier than any of these we find the sobriquet
‘Swartbrand.’ Thus we see the arm wielded a
powerful influence over names as well as people, no
mere accident in a day when ‘might was right.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>‘Main,’ when not local, corresponds to the Saxon
‘Hand,’ and is found in composition in such designations
as ‘Blanchmains,’ that is, white-hand, ‘Grauntmains,’
big-hand, ‘Tortesmain,’ twisted-hand, ‘Malemeyn,’
evil-hand, or perhaps maimed-hand, equivalent
therefore to ‘Male-braunch’ (found at the same early
date) in ‘Mainstrong,’ a mere variation of ‘Armstrong,’
and in ‘Quarterman,’ scarcely recognisable in such an
English-like form as the Norman ‘Quatre-main,’ the
four-handed. In the reign of the second Richard it
had become registered as ‘Quatremayn’ and ‘Quatreman,’
and the inversion of the two letters in this latter
case was of course inevitable.<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c009'><sup>[459]</sup></a> ‘Brazdifer,’ I have
said, is extinct—not so, however, ‘Pedifer’ (‘Bernard
Pedefer,’ G., ‘Fulbert Pedefer,’ X.), that is, iron-footed,
which, occurring from the earliest times, still looks
stout and hearty in its present guise of ‘Petifer,’
‘Pettifer,’<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c009'><sup>[460]</sup></a> and ‘Potiphar,’ though the last would seem
to claim for it a pedigree nearly as ancient as that of
the Welshman who, <i>half-way</i> up his genealogical tree,
had made the interesting note: ‘About this time
Adam was born.’ Even this name, however, did not
escape translation, for we find an ‘Ironfoot’ (‘Peter
Yrenefot,’ A.) recorded at the same date as the above.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c009'><sup>[461]</sup></a>
Our ‘Legges,’ our ‘Shanks’ and ‘Footes,’<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c009'><sup>[462]</sup></a> are all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>familiar to us, though the first is in most cases undoubtedly
local, as being but an olden form of
‘Leigh.’<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c009'><sup>[463]</sup></a> We all remember the inimitable couplet
placed over the memorial to Samuel Foote, the
comedian—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here lies one <i>Foote</i>, whose death may thousands save,</div>
      <div class='line'>For death has now one <i>foot</i> within the grave.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Jambe’ was the Norman synonym of ‘Shank,’ and
by way of more definite distinction we light upon the
somewhat flattering ‘Bellejambe,’ the equally unflattering
‘Foljambe,’ the doubtful ‘Greyshank,’<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c009'><sup>[464]</sup></a> the
historic ‘Longshank,’ the hapless ‘Cruikshank’ or
‘Bowshank,’<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c009'><sup>[465]</sup></a> the decidedly uncomplimentary ‘Sheepshank,’
and, last and worst, ‘Pelkeshank,’ seemingly
intended to be ‘Pelican-shanked,’ which, when we
recall the peculiar disproportion of that bird’s extremities
to the rest of its body, affords ample reason
for the absence of that sobriquet in our more modern
rolls. Some fifty years ago a certain Mr. Sheepshanks,
of Jesus College, Cambridge, while undergoing an
examination in Juvenal, pronounced ‘satire’ ‘satyr.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>A wag, thereupon, wrote the following epigram, which
soon found its way through the University:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The satyrs of old were satyrs of note,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the head of a man, they’d the shanks of a goat:</div>
      <div class='line'>But the satyr of Jesus all satyrs surpasses,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whilst his <i>shanks</i> are a <i>sheep’s</i>, his head is an ass’s.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Swiftness of foot was not allowed to go unrecorded,
and we have an interesting instance of the way in
which this class of surnames arose from an entry
recorded in the ‘Issues of the Exchequer.’ There
we find a ‘Ralph Swyft’ mentioned as <i>courier</i> to
Edward III. Nothing could be more natural than
for such a sobriquet to become affixed to a man
fulfilling an office like this, requiring, as it did at
times, all the running and riding powers of which he
could be capable.<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c009'><sup>[466]</sup></a> Other memorials of former agility
in this respect are still preserved in our ‘Golightlys’<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c009'><sup>[467]</sup></a>
and ‘Lightfoots,’ while of still earlier date, and more
poetical form, we may instance ‘Harefoot’ and ‘Roefoot.’
These, however, are altogether inexpressive in
comparison with such a sobriquet as ‘Scherewind’ or
‘Shearwind,’ which seems to have been a familiar expression
at this time, for I find it recorded in three
several rolls. It is strange, and yet not strange, that
every peculiarity that can mark the human gait is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>distinctly preserved in our nomenclature. ‘Isabel
Stradling’ or ‘William Stradling’ represent the
<i>straddle</i>; ‘Thomas le Ambler’ or ‘Ralph le Ambuler’
(when not occupative), the <i>amble</i>; our ‘Shailers,’
‘Shaylors,’ and ‘Shaylers,’ the <i>shuffle</i>; ‘Robert le
Liltere,’ the <i>hop</i>; our ‘Scamblers’ and ‘Shamblers,’
the weak-kneed <i>shamble</i>; ‘Ralph le Todeler,’ the
<i>toddle</i>; and ‘Samuel Trotman’ or ‘Richard Trotter’
(when not occupative), the <i>trot</i>, if that be possible on
two legs. Besides these, we may mention the obsolete
‘Thomas Petitpas’ or ‘John Petypase,’ ‘William
Noblepas,’ and ‘Malpas,’ which we might Saxonize
into ‘Short-step,’ ‘High-step,’ and ‘Bad-step.’ ‘Christiana
Lameman’ and ‘William Laymeman’ remind
us of more pitiable weaknesses. ‘Barefoot’ may have
been the designation of some one under penitential
routine, unless it be a corruption of ‘Bearfoot.’
‘Proudfoot’ and ‘Platfoot’ (plat = flat) need no comment,
while ‘Sikelfoot,’ found by Mr. Lower as existing
in the thirteenth century, seems, as he says, to
bespeak a splayed appearance or outward twist.<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c009'><sup>[468]</sup></a> If
this be so, the owner was not alone in his distress.
We have just mentioned ‘Cruikshank.’ Our ‘Crooks’
are, I doubt not, of similar origin, and another compound
of the same, now obsolete, was ‘Crookbone’
(‘Henry Crokebane,’ A.). Our ‘Crumps’ are but
relics of the old ‘Richard le Crumpe’ or ‘Hugh le
Crump,’ the crookbacked, and perhaps our ‘Cramps’
and ‘Crimps’ are but changes rung on the same. Our
nursery literature still preserves the story of the ‘cow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>with the crumpled horn.’ Thus, also, was it with our
‘Cams,’ once ‘William le Cam.’ As a Celtic stream-name,
denoting a winding course, it has survived the
aggressions of Saxon and Norman, and is still familiar.
Cambridge and Camford are on two different streams
of this name. In the north a man is still said to ‘cam
his shoe’ who wears it down on one side. I have
heard the phrase often among the poorer classes of
Lancashire. ‘Camoys’ or ‘Camuse,’ from the same
root, was generally applied to the nasal organ. In
the description of the Miller, which I shall have occasion
to quote again shortly, Chaucer says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A Sheffield thwitel bare he in his hose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Round was his face, and camuse was his nose.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>As, however, I find both ‘John le Camoys’ and
‘Reginald de Camoys,’ it is only a fair presumption
that in some cases it is of Norman local origin. With
one of our leading families it is undoubtedly so. The
two great clans of ‘Cameron’ and ‘Campbell,’ I may
say in passing, though treading upon Scottish soil, are
said to mean severally ‘crook-nosed’ and ‘crook-mouthed.’
If this be so, we may see how firmly has
this little word imbedded itself upon our nomenclature,
if not upon our more general vocabulary. Not to
mention ‘Crypling,’ ‘Handless,’ and ‘Onehand,’<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c009'><sup>[469]</sup></a> we
find ‘Blind’ significative of blindness; ‘Daffe’ and
‘Daft,’ of deafness; ‘Mutter’ and ‘Stutter,’ not to say
‘Stuttard’ and ‘Stammer,’ of lisping speech; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>‘Dumbard,’ of utter incapacity in that respect. Such
a sobriquet as ‘Mad’<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c009'><sup>[470]</sup></a> of course explains itself. As
we might well presume, this has not come down to us.
Still less pleasant in their associations are our ‘Burls’
(‘Henry le Burle,’ A.), that is, blotch-skinned. But
complimentary allusions to the smoothness of the
hands and face were not wanting. Apart from a
touch of poetry, such names as ‘Elizabeth Lyllywhite,’
now ‘Lilywhite;’ ‘William Beauflour,’ now spelt
‘Boutflower’ and ‘Buffler;’ and ‘Faith Blanchflower,’
still existing also, are not without a certain prettiness.
Of equally clear complexion would be the obsolete
‘William Whiteflesh’ or ‘Gilbert Whitehand’<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c009'><sup>[471]</sup></a> or
‘Robert Blanchmains,’ not to mention our ‘Chits’
and ‘Chittys’ (‘John le Chit,’ A., ‘Agnes Chittye,’ Z.).
We still talk in our nurseries of a ‘little chit,’ a word
which, though strictly speaking confined to no age,
had early become a pet name as applied to young
children. It is with these, therefore, we must ally our
‘Slicks,’ from ‘sleek,’ ‘smooth,’<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c009'><sup>[472]</sup></a> ‘Sam Slick’ being
by no means in possession of an imaginary name.
Chaucer says of ‘Idleness,’ in his Romance—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Her flesh tender as is a chicke</div>
      <div class='line'>With bent browes; smooth and slicke.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is astonishing how carefully will a sobriquet of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>undoubtedly complimentary nature find itself preserved.
Such a name as ‘Hugh le Bell’ or ‘Richard
le Bell’ is an instance in point.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c009'><sup>[473]</sup></a> While objectionable
designations, or even those of but equivocal character,
have been gradually shuffled off or barely allowed to
survive, the mere fact of this being at the present day
one of the most familiar, and in respect of sobriquet
nomenclature the absolutely most common, of our
surnames, shows that the human heart is not altered
by lapse of generations, and that pride then, as now,
wielded a powerful sceptre over the minds of men.
Our ‘Belhams’ represent but the fuller ‘Bellehomme’
(‘William Bellehomme,’ M.). Thus the two may be
set against our Saxon ‘Prettys’ and ‘Prettimans,’<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c009'><sup>[474]</sup></a>
though ‘pretty’ would scarcely find itself so acceptable
now, denoting as it does a style of beauty rather
too effeminate for the lords of creation. In the Hundred
Rolls occur ‘Matilda Winsome’ and ‘Alicia
Welliking.’ Both these terms, complimentary as they
undoubtedly were, are now obsolete, so far as our
directories are concerned.</p>

<h4 class='c027'>(2) <i>Nicknames from Peculiarities of Complexion.</i></h4>
<p class='c018'>After all, however, it is, perhaps, complexion which
has occupied for itself the largest niche in our more
general nomenclature. Nor is this unnatural. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>still that which, in describing people, we seize upon as
the best means of recognition. Sobriquets of this
kind were so numerous, indeed, that there was no
term in the vocabulary of the day which could be
used to denote the colour of the dress, the hair, or the
face, which did not find itself a place among our
surnames.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the same with our beasts of burden or
animals of the chase. In these days their hides
almost invariably furnished forth their current designations.
Thus we find the horse familiarly
known by such titles as ‘Morell,’ from its moorish
or swarthy tan, or ‘Lyard,’ that is, dapple-grey, or
‘Bayard,’ bay, or ‘Favell,’ dun, or ‘Blank,’ white.
The dark hide of the ass got for it the sobriquet
of ‘Dun,’ a term still preserved in the old proverb,
‘As dull as Dun in the mire,’ while again
as ‘Burnell’ its browner aspect will be familiar
to all readers of Chaucer. Thus, also, the fox was
known as ‘Russell,’ the bear as ‘Bruin,’ and the
young hind, from its early indefinite red, ‘Sorrell.’
How natural that the same custom should have its
effect upon human nomenclature. How easy for a
country community to create the distinction between
‘John le Rouse’ and ‘John le Black,’ ‘William le
Hore’ and ‘William le Sor’ or ‘Sorrell,’ if the complexion
of the hair or face were sufficiently distinctive
to allow it. Some of these adjectives were applied
to human peculiarities of this kind till within recent
times. Burns uses ‘lyart’ for locks of iron grey,
and Aubyn, in his ‘Lives,’ describes Butler, author
of ‘Hudibras,’ as having ‘a head of sorrell haire.’
We ourselves talk of ‘brunettes’ and ‘blondes,’ of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>‘dark’ and ‘fair.’ Thus it was then such sobriquets
as ‘Philip le Sor,’ ‘Adam le Morell,’ ‘William le
Favele’ or ‘Favell,’ ‘Walter le Bay’ or ‘Theobald
le Bayard,’ ‘Henry le Dun’ or ‘Thomas le Lyard,’
arose. Thus was it our ‘Rouses’ and ‘Russells,’
our ‘Brownes’<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c009'><sup>[475]</sup></a> and ‘Brunes,’ with the obsolete
‘Brunman,’ or ‘Brunells’ and ‘Burnells,’ our ‘Whites’
and ‘Whitemans,’ our ‘Hores’ and ‘Hoares,’ our
‘Greys’ and ‘Grissels’<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c009'><sup>[476]</sup></a> sprang into being. Nor are
these all. Our ‘Reeds,’ ‘Reids,’ and ‘Reads’ are all
but forms of the old ‘rede’ or red, once so pronounced;<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c009'><sup>[477]</sup></a>
while ‘Redman,’ when not a descendant
of ‘Adam’ or ‘Thomas de Redmayne,’ is the bequest
of some ‘Robert’ or ‘John Redman’ of the
thirteenth century. Our ‘Swarts’ are but relics of
the old ‘John le Swarte,’ applied no doubt to the
tawny or sunburnt face of its original owner. The
word was in common use at this time. In ‘Guy of
Warwick’ we are told:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His nek is greater than a bole,</div>
      <div class='line'>His body is swarter than ani cole.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The darker-hued countenances of our forefathers are
immortalised also in such entries as ‘Reyner le
Blake’ or ‘Stephen le Blak,’ now found as ‘Blake’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>and ‘Black,’ or ‘Elias le Blakeman’ or ‘Henry Blacman,’
now ‘Blakeman’ and ‘Blackman’ respectively.
‘John le Blanc’ and ‘Warin Blench’ find themselves
in the nineteenth century supported by our ‘Blanks’
and ‘Blanches;’<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c009'><sup>[478]</sup></a> while the descendants of such people
as ‘Amabilla le Blund,’ or ‘Walter le Blunt,’ or ‘Reginald
le Blond,’ or ‘Richard le Blount’ still preserve a
memorial of their ancestry in such familiar forms as
‘Blund,’ ‘Blunt,’ ‘Blond,’ and ‘Blount.’ ‘Blanket’
and ‘Blanchet,’ as fuller forms, we shall notice shortly,
and ‘Blondin,’ ‘Blundell,’ and the immortalised but
mythic ‘Blondel’ are but changes rung upon the
others. Our ‘Fallows’ are but relics of the ‘Fales’
and ‘Falemans’ of the Hundred Rolls. The somewhat
pallid yellow they represented we still apply to
park deer and untilled earth. We find it, however,
used more personally in the ‘Knight’s Tale,’ where it
is said of Arcite that he began to wax lean—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His eye hollow, and grisly to behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>His hewe falew, and pale as ashen cold.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Scarlet’ doubtless was a sobriquet given, as may
have been some of the above, from the colour of the
dress, this being a very popular complexion of cloth
in early days. Tripping it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In skerlet kyrtells, every one,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>would be a familiar and pretty sight, no doubt, as the
village maidens went round to the tune of the fife and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>tabor at the rural feast or ingathering, nor would
umbrage be taken at the title. Several ‘Blues’ are
recorded in the more Norman-French form of ‘le
Bleu.’ Whether they still exist I am not quite sure,
nor are we helped to any satisfactory conclusion by
the epitaph which Mr. Lower wisely italicises, when he
says <i>it is said</i> to exist in a church in Berkshire—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>There may be more or less doubt as to the precise
reference some of the above-mentioned names
bear to the physical peculiarities of their owners,
whether to the complexion of the face, or the hair,
or, as I have lately hinted, to the dress. But in
many other cases there can be no such controversy.
For instance, no one can be in perplexity as to how
our ‘Downyheads,’ ‘Rufheads,’<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c009'><sup>[479]</sup></a> ‘Hardheads,’ ‘Whiteheads,’
‘Redheads,’ ‘Flaxenheads,’<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c009'><sup>[480]</sup></a> ‘Shavenheads,’
‘Goldenheads,’ ‘Weaselheads,’<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c009'><sup>[481]</sup></a> ‘Coxheads’ or ‘Cocksheads,’
and ‘Greenheads’ arose, many of which, now
extinct, were evidently intended to be obnoxious.
Nor is there any greater difficulty in deciphering
the meaning of such names as ‘Whitelock’ or ‘Whitlock,’
‘Silverlock’ or ‘Blacklock.’ ‘Shakelock’ seems
to refer to some eccentricity on the part of the owner,
unless it be but a corruption of ‘Shacklock,’ a likely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>sobriquet for a gaoler, from the fetterlocks, once so
termed, which he was wont to employ—</p>

<p class='c017'>‘Whitehair,’<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c009'><sup>[482]</sup></a> ‘Fairhair,’<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c009'><sup>[483]</sup></a> and ‘Yalowhair,’ are equally
transparent. The latter was once a decidedly favourite
hue, as I believe it is still, only we now say ‘golden.’<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c009'><sup>[484]</sup></a>
With the gross flattery so commonly resorted to by
courtier historians, every princess was described as
having yellow tresses. How they allowed themselves
to be so cajoled is an equally historic mystery. Queen
Elizabeth had more obsequious adulation uttered to
her face, and possessed a greater stomach for it, than
any other royal personage who ever sat upon or laid
claim to a crown, but nothing pleased her more than
a compliment upon her golden locks, carroty as they
really were. In a description of another Elizabeth,
the Queen of Henry VII., as she appeared before her
coronation, 1487, quoted by Mr. Way, it is said that
she wore ‘her faire yellow hair hanging down pleyne
behynd her back, with a calle of pipes over it,’ and
further back still, when Chaucer would describe the
beauty of Dame Gladness, he must needs finish off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>the portrayal by touching up her locks with the
popular hue—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Her hair was yellow, and clear shining,</div>
      <div class='line'>I wot no lady so liking.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Yalowhair’ is obsolete, but in our ‘Fairfax’ is preserved
a sobriquet commemorative no doubt of the
same favoured colour. In ‘Sir Gawayne’ we are told,
after the alliterative style of the day, how ‘<i>fair</i> fanning
<i>fax</i>’ encircled the shoulders of the doughty warrior.
In the ‘Townley Mysteries,’ too, a demon is represented
in one place as saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A horne, and a Dutch axe,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His sleeve must be flecked,</div>
      <div class='line'>A syde head, and a fare fax,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His goune must be specked.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Beard,’ once entered as ‘Peter Wi’-the-berd,’ or
‘Hugo cum-Barbâ,’ still thrives in our midst; and
even ‘Copperbeard,’ ‘Greybeard,’ ‘Blackbeard,’<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c009'><sup>[485]</sup></a> and
‘Whitebeard’ contrive to exist. ‘Redbeard’<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c009'><sup>[486]</sup></a> together
with ‘Featherbeard,’ ‘Eaglebeard,’ ‘Wisebeard,’
and ‘Brownbeard,’<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c009'><sup>[487]</sup></a> have long disappeared, and ‘Bluebeard,’
of whose dread existence we were, as children,
only too awfully assured, has also left no descendants;
but this, I fancy, we gather from his history. ‘Lovelock’
is a relic of the once familiar plaited and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>beribboned lock which I have already alluded to, as
having been familiarly worn by our forefathers of
the more exquisite type. To the same peculiar, if
not effeminate propensity, we owe, I doubt not,
‘Locke’ (‘Nicol Locke,’ A.) itself, not to mention
‘Curl’ (‘Marcus Curle,’ Z.) and ‘Crisp’ (‘Reginald le
Crispe,’ J.). The former of these two, however, seems
to denote the natural waviness, the latter the artificial
production. In the poem from which I have
but just quoted we find the same hero described as
having his hair—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Well crisped and cemmed (combed) with knots full many,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and a memorial of the fashion still lingers in the
‘crisping pins’ of our present Bible version. In the
Hundred Rolls appears the sobriquet of ‘Prikeavant.’
This, as Mr. Lower proves, lingered on till the close
at least of the seventeenth century, in the form of
‘Prick-advance.’<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c009'><sup>[488]</sup></a> I cannot agree with him, however,
that it arose as a mere spur-expression. I doubt not
it is but the earlier form of the later ‘pickedevaunt,’
the pointed or spiked beard so much in vogue in
mediæval times. The word occurs in the ‘Taming
of a Shrew’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Boy, oh! disgrace to my person! Sounes, boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of your face! You have many boys with such</div>
      <div class='line'>Pickedevaunts, I am sure.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Nothing could be more natural than for such a custom
as this to find itself memorialised in our nomenclature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>Exaggeration in the habit would easily affix the name
upon the wearer, and though not very euphonious as
a surname, the popularity of the usage would take
from its unpleasantness. This also will explain
‘Thomas Stykebeard,’ found in the H.R. at this
time. But let us turn for a moment to an opposite
peculiarity. Though we often talk of getting our
heads polled, few, I imagine, reflect that our ‘Pollards’
must have obtained their title from their well-shorn
appearance. It is with them, therefore, we must set
our ‘Notts,’ ‘Notmans,’ and doubtless some of our
‘Knotts.’ The term ‘nott’ was evidently synonymous
with ‘shorn,’ and to have a nothead was to
have the hair closely cut all round the head. It
is still commonly done in some parts of the country
among the peasantry. Chaucer, describing the ‘Yeoman,’
says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A not-hed hadde he, with a browne visage.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Andrew Boorde, too, later on, writing of the ‘Mores
whyche do dwel in Barbary,’ says: ‘They have gret
lyppes and nottyd heare, black and curled.’<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c009'><sup>[489]</sup></a> The
name as a sobriquet is very common in the old
registers. Among other instances may be mentioned
‘Henry le Not’ and ‘Herbert le Notte’ in the
‘Placitorum’ at Westminster. Nature, however, did
for our ‘Callows’ what art had done for the latter.
The term is written ‘calewe’ with our earlier writers,
and in this form is found as a surname in 1313, one
‘Richard le Calewe,’ or bald-headed, occurring in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>Parliamentary Writs for that year. We still talk of
fledgelings as ‘callow young.’ From its Latin root
‘calvus,’<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c009'><sup>[490]</sup></a> and through the French ‘chauve,’ we get
also the early ‘John le Chauf,’ ‘Geoffrey le Cauf,’
and ‘Richard le Chaufyn’—forms which still abide
with us in our ‘Corfes’ and ‘Caffins.’ Our ‘Balls’ are
manifestly sprung from some ‘Custance Balde’ or
‘Richard Bald.’ But there is yet one more name to
be mentioned in this category, that of ‘Peel’ or
‘Peile,’ descended, as it doubtless is in many cases,
from such folk as ‘Thomas le Pele’ or ‘William le
Pyl.’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As pilled as an ape was his crown</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>is the not very complimentary description Chaucer
gives of the Miller of Trumpington. It is but the
same word as occurs in our Authorised Version of
Ezekiel xxix. 18, where it is said: ‘Every head was
made bald, and every shoulder was peeled.’ In
Isaiah xviii. 2, too, we read of a ‘nation scattered
and peeled,’ the marginal reading being ‘outspread
and polished.’<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c009'><sup>[491]</sup></a> Used as a surname, it seems to have
denoted that glossy smoothness, that utter guiltlessness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>of capillary protection which belongs only to
elderly gentlemen, and even then to but a few.<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c009'><sup>[492]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It can be no matter of astonishment to us, when
we reflect upon it, that our nomenclature should owe
so much to this one single specialty of the human
physique. The face is the mark of all recognition
among men, and how much of its character belongs
to the simple appanage we have been speaking of
we may easily gather from the difference the slightest
change in the style of dressing or cutting it makes
among those with whom we are most familiar. Looking
back at what has been recorded, what a living
proof they afford us of the truth of Horace Smith’s
assertion that surnames ‘ever go by contraries.’ The
art of colouring may be hereditary, but certainly not
the dyes themselves. Who ever saw a ‘Whytehead’
who was not dark, or a ‘Blacklock’ who was not a
blonde? Who ever saw reddish hair on a ‘Russell,’
or a swarthy complexion on a ‘Morell’? How
invariably does it happen that our ‘Lightfoots’ are
gouty, and our ‘Hales’ dyspeptic, our ‘Bigges’ are
manikins, and our ‘Littles’ giants. Such are the
tricks that Time plays with us. Recorded history
gives us the slow development of change in the habits
and customs of domestic life, but here we can compare
the physical shifts of the family itself. As
history and everything else, however, are said to
repeat themselves, we may comfort or condole with,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>as the case may require, those who, if this dictum,
like the Pope’s, be infallible, shall some time or other
return to their primitive hues and original proportions.</p>

<h4 class='c027'>(3) <i>Nicknames from Peculiarities of Dress and Accoutrements.</i></h4>
<p class='c018'>An interesting peep into the minuter details of
mediæval life is given us in the case of names derived
from costume and ensigncy, whether peaceful or warlike.
The colour of the cloth of which the dress was
composed seems to have furnished us with several
surnames. For instance, our ‘Burnets’ would seem
to be associated with the fabric of a brown mixture
common at one period. Our great early poet, in
describing Avarice, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A mantle hung her faste by</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon a benche weak and small,</div>
      <div class='line'>A burnette cote hung there withall,</div>
      <div class='line'>Furred with no minevere,</div>
      <div class='line'>But with a furre rough of hair.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It was the same with our ‘Burrels’ (‘Roger Burell,’ J.,
‘Robert Burell,’ R.), whom I have already had occasion
to mention. So familiar was this cloth that the
poorer classes acquired from it the sobriquet of ‘borelfolk.’
This is only analogous to the French ‘grisette,’
from the grey cheap stuff she usually wore. Our
‘Blankets’ (‘Robert Blanket,’ B., ‘John Blanket,’ X.)
or ‘Blanchets’ or ‘Plunkets,’<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c009'><sup>[493]</sup></a> for all these forms are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>found, are in the same way but relics of the time when
the colourless woollen mixture, called by all these
names, was in everyday demand, whether for dress or
coverlet. A story has been spread abroad that our
woollen ‘blanket’ owes its origin to a man of that
name, who first manufactured it. Even otherwise
well-informed writers have lent themselves to the
furtherance of this fable. ‘Blanket’ was originally
the name of a cheap woollen cloth, used for the
apparel of the lower orders, and so entitled from its
pale and colourless hue, just as <i>russet</i> and <i>burrel</i> were
in vogue to express similar manufactures of more
decided colours. It was but the Norman form of the
Saxon ‘whittle,’ once the household word for this
fabric. Thus we find it occurring in an old Act,
already referred to, passed in 1363, to restrict the
dress of the peasantry:—All people not possessing 40
shillings’ worth of goods and chattels ‘ne usent nule
manere de drap, si noun blanket et russet, laune de
xii<i>d.</i>,’ that is, shall not take nor wear any manner of
cloth, but blanket and russet wool of twelvepence.
(<i>Stat. Realm</i>, vol. i. p. 381.) An old indenture of
goods contains the following:—‘Item, 1 olde Kendale
gowne, and a hood of the same, pris ix<i>d.</i>, the gowne
lynyd with white blanket.’ (<i>Mun. Acad. Oxon.</i>,
p. 566.) Both ‘Whittle’ and ‘Blanket’ are existing
surnames. The reader will see from these references
alone that, whether in the case of the man or the
manufacture, it is the colour, or rather lack of colour,
which has given the sobriquet. Our ‘Greenmans,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>whether as surname or tavern sign, are but sprung
from the old forester—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Clad in cote and hode of grene,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>of Lincoln or Kendal make. The ‘Greenman’ was
a favourite rural signboard, and I doubt not the
reader will have seen it occasionally swinging still in
the more retired parts of the country. Crabbe knew
it well in his day—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But the ‘Green Man’ shall I pass by unsung,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which mine own James upon his signpost hung?</div>
      <div class='line'>His sign, his image—for he once was seen</div>
      <div class='line'>A squire’s attendant, clad in keeper’s green.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Turning from the colour of the cloth to the garments
into which it was fashioned, nothing could be
more natural to our forefathers than to take off with
a sobriquet the more whimsical aspects of dress indulged
in by particular individuals. Royalty itself
did not escape. It was through his introduction of
a new fashion our second Henry got his nickname of
‘Curtmantel,’ and this was matched by ‘Capet’ and
‘Grisegonel’ across the water. ‘Richard Curtepy’
reminds us of the poor clerk of whom Chaucer says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Full thredbare was his overest courtepy,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>that is, his cloak or gabardine. ‘Henry Curtmantle,’
just mentioned, ‘Martin Curtwallet,’ and ‘Robert
Curthose’ (still existing in Derbyshire in the more
Saxon form of ‘Shorthose’),<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c009'><sup>[494]</sup></a> satirise the introduction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>of a curtailment in the general as ‘Reginald Curtbrant’
does in the more military habit; ‘Richard
Widehose’ and the Scotch ‘Macklehose,’ on the other
hand, suggesting a change of an opposite and more
sailorlike character. ‘Hose,’ itself a surname, is again
found in composition in ‘Richard Goldhose,’ ‘Nicholas
Strokehose,’ ‘John Scrothose’ (‘Scratchhose,’), and
‘Richard Letherhose;’ the latter still to be met with
in Germany as ‘Ledderhose.’ ‘Emma Wastehose,’
though now obsolete, evidently bespoke the reckless
habits of the wearer, while ‘John Sprenhose’ (<i>i.e.</i>,
‘Spurnhose’) seems to have declared its owner’s want
of appreciation of that article altogether. The old
‘paletoque’ or doublet, a loose kind of frock often
worn by priests, left itself a memorial in ‘Thomas
Pyletok,’ which is now extinct, but ‘Pylch’ (‘Symon
Pylche,’ A.), the maker of which has already been
mentioned, remains hale and hearty in our midst.
‘Mantel’ (‘Walter Mantel,’ L.) and ‘Fremantel’<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c009'><sup>[495]</sup></a> are
well established among us, the latter probably owing
its origin to the frieze-cloth which the Frieslander of
the Low Countries once manufactured out of our own
wool. It is Latinized in our records into ‘Hugh
de Frigido-Mantello,’ and the cloth itself as ‘Frisius
pannus.’<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c009'><sup>[496]</sup></a> The herald’s tunic, barely covering the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>chest and open from the shoulder downwards, gave
us our ‘Tabards.’ It must have had plenty of last
in it, for Piers Plowman talks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A tawny tabard of twelf wynters age.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The variegated dress, much in favour then apparently,
still survives in our ‘Medlecote’ and ‘Medlicott.’<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c009'><sup>[497]</sup></a>
The stuffed doublet gave us ‘Thomas Gambeson,’
now perhaps ‘Gamson,’ while the short petticoat is
memorialised in ‘John Grenecurtel.’ ‘Alicia Caperon’
and ‘Thomas Chaperoun’ are early found. The
<i>chaperon</i> was a hood by which the entire face could
be concealed if it were so desired. Taylor, in the
seventeenth century, mentions it as but recently out of
fashion—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Her <i>shapperoones</i>, her periwigs and tires,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are reliques which this flattery much admires.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is thus, by a somewhat strange but easy association
of ideas, has come our modern protector in society so
called.</p>
<p class='c007'>Excess of apparel has often in olden days been
under penal statute. Chaucer, in his time, decried
its abuse, and an old rhyme of Edward III. date is
still preserved, which is scathing enough—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Longbeards, heartlesse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Painted hoods, witlesse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gaycoates, gracelesse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Makes England thriftlesse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>We are reminded in this of ‘Gai-cote’ (‘William
Gaicote,’ A.), which once was a surname, though now
extinct. ‘Woolward’ or ‘Woolard’ (‘Geoffey Woleward,’
A., ‘Reginald Wolleward,’ N.) still thrives.
To go ‘woolward’ was to undergo the penance of
wearing the outer woollen cloth without any linen
under-dress. It was often prescribed by the priesthood.
Piers, in his Vision, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Wolleward</i> and weetshoed</div>
      <div class='line'>Wente I forth;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>while another old poem bids us—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Faste, and go <i>wolward</i>, and wake,</div>
      <div class='line'>And suffre hard for Godys sake.<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c009'><sup>[498]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The name was not an unfrequent one at the
time of which I am writing, and I doubt not was
oftentimes familiarly applied to friars. We must
probably refer to more warlike accoutrements for the
origin of our ‘Gantletts’ or ‘Gauntletts’ (‘Henry
Gauntelett,’ Z., ‘Roger Gauntlet,’ Z.), our ‘Pallets’
and ‘Vizards.’ The latter was that part of the helmet
which was perforated for the wearer to see
through, ‘pallet’ being the general term for the
helmet itself. ‘Ranulf Strong-bowe’ was a likely
sobriquet for a brawny-armed bowman to acquire,
and, like ‘Isabella Fortiscue’ (brave shield) and
‘Emelina Longespee,’ belongs to more general history.
‘Sword,’ ‘Buckler,’ ‘Lance,’<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c009'><sup>[499]</sup></a> ‘Spear,’ ‘Pike,’
‘Bill,’ the renowned ‘Brownbill,’ and others too many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>for enumeration, have similarly found a place in our
nomenclature. What a revolution in the mode of
warfare do they betoken. What a sweeping change
has the invention of gunpowder effected on the battlegrounds
of Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>But I mentioned ‘badges.’ It is amusing to see
how the early love of distinctive ensigns has made its
mark here. While it is an English instinct to reverence
authority, this authority itself has ever been
distinguished by the outward manifestation of dress
and emblem. The ceremonious requirements of the
feudal state have had their effect. As I endeavoured
to show in a previous chapter, these were simply overwhelming.
The office of each was not more distinct
than his outward accompaniments, and it was by the
latter his precise position was known. The ‘baton,’
however, seems to have held the foremost place as a
token of authority—a sword, a javelin, a spear, a
wand, a rod, it mattered not what, a something borne
in the hand, and you might have known in that day
an official. Nor are we as yet free from its influence.
Royalty still has its sceptre, the Household of State
its ‘black rod,’ magistracy has its mace, proctorship
its poker, the churchwarden his staff, the beadle—far
the most important of all to the charity children and
himself—his stick. From official, this rage for badges
seems to have passed on to the quieter and more
ordinary avocations. The shepherd was not better
known by his crook, the huntsman not better known
by his horn, than the pilgrim by his ‘bourdon,’ the
woodward by his ‘bill,’ or the surveyor by his ‘meteyard’<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c009'><sup>[500]</sup></a>
or ‘metewand.’ How easy then for all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>words to be turned into sobriquets. How natural
they should become slang epithets for those who
carried them. How natural that we should find them
all in our directories. ‘Meatyard,’ ‘Burdon’ or
‘Bourdon,’ ‘Crook,’ ‘Wand,’ ‘Staff,’ ‘Rodd,’ ‘Horne,’<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c009'><sup>[501]</sup></a>
all are there. Nor did the personal characteristics of
such bearers escape the good-humoured raillery of our
ancestors. Far from it. ‘Waghorn,’<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c009'><sup>[502]</sup></a> would easily
fix itself upon some awkward horn-blower; ‘Wagspear’
(‘Mabill Wagspere,’ W. 1.), or ‘Shakespeare’
(‘William Shakespeare,’ V. 1.), or ‘Shakeshaft’<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c009'><sup>[503]</sup></a> or
‘Drawsword’ (‘Henry Drawswerde,’ A.), or ‘Drawespe’
(‘Thomas Drawespe,’ A.) upon some over-demonstrative
sergeant or clearer of the way; or
‘Wagstaffe’ (‘Robert Waggestaff,’ A.) on some obnoxious
beadle.<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c009'><sup>[504]</sup></a> ‘Tipstaffe’ we know for certain as
a name of this class—he was a bumbailiff. In 1392
one Roger Andrew was publicly indicted for pretending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>to be an officer of the Marshalsea, which he did
by bearing a ‘wooden staff with horn at either end,
called a “tippestaffe.”’ It does not seem, however,
to have been confined only to him. Chaucer says of
the frère, that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With scrippe, and tipped staf, tucked high</div>
      <div class='line'>In every house he gan to pore and pry;</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c017'>which thus explicitly explains the term. The same

(perchance ‘Hale-staff’),<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c009'><sup>[506]</sup></a> and ‘Thomas Ploghstaf’
(Plowstaff). With one or two more general terms of
this class we may proceed. ‘Robert Hurlebat’<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c009'><sup>[507]</sup></a> and
‘Matthew Winspear,’ ‘Richard Spurdaunce’ and
‘Robert Bruselance,’ ‘Simon Lovelaunce’ and ‘Thomas
Crakyshield,’<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c009'><sup>[508]</sup></a> ‘Roger Benbow,’ ‘Cicely Brownsword,’
and ‘Thomas Shotbolte,’ are evidently nicknames
fastened upon certain individuals for special prowess
in some of the sports of the Middle Ages, probably
at some church-ale or wakes.</p>

<h4 class='c027'>(1) <i>Nicknames from Peculiarities of Disposition—Complimentary.</i></h4>
<p class='c018'>Let us now turn to the varied characteristics of
the human heart. If we wish to know how many
good and excellent qualities there are in the world,
and at the same time deceive ourselves into a belief
that the evils are few, we must look into our directories.
Scan their contents, and we might almost persuade
ourselves that Utopia was a fact, and that we
were consulting its muster-roll. At every turn we meet
with virtue in the guise of a ‘Goode,’ or an ‘Upright,’
or a ‘Righteous,’<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c009'><sup>[509]</sup></a> or a ‘Patient,’ or a ‘Best,’ or a ‘Faithful;’
or infallibility in a ‘Perfect’ or ‘Faultless.’ We
are ever coming across philosophy in the shape of a
‘Wise’ or a ‘Sage.’ Conscience must surely trouble
but little, where ‘Merry’ and ‘Gay,’ ‘Blythe’ and
‘Joyce,’ that is, joyous, are all but interminable; and
companionship must be ever sweet with such people
to converse with as ‘Makepeace’<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c009'><sup>[510]</sup></a> and ‘Friend,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>‘Goodhart’ and ‘Truman,’ ‘True’ and ‘Leal,’ ‘Kind’
and ‘Curtis’ or ‘Curteis.’ ‘Fulhardy’ and ‘Giddyhead,’
‘Cruel’ and ‘Fierce,’ ‘Wilfulle’ and ‘Sullen,’
and ‘Envious’ did indeed find a habitation in its
pages, but they have long since disappeared, being
quite out of place in the presence of such better folk
as ‘Hardy’<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c009'><sup>[511]</sup></a> and ‘Grave,’ and ‘Gentle’ and ‘Sweet;’
or if the cloven foot of pride be still visible in ‘Proud’
and ‘Proudfoot,’ it is nevertheless under constant rebuke
by our familiarity with such lowly characters as
‘Humble’ and ‘Meek.’<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c009'><sup>[512]</sup></a> Nevertheless, this was anything
but so in the old time. The evil roots of sin
may still abide hale and strong and ineradicable in the
heart of man, but he has carefully weeded the more
apparent traces of this out of his nomenclature. I do
not mean to say we are utterly without names of objectionable
import, but we shall see that what I have
stated once before is true in the main. We shall see
that as a rule it is only when the sobriquet word has
changed its meaning, or that meaning become obscure
and doubtful, or when the name itself has lost the
traces of its origin—easy enough in the lapse of so
many days of unsettled orthography—that the surname
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>has lingered on. This will make itself apparent
as we advance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such names as ‘Walter Snel,’ ‘Richard Quicke’ (A.),
including the immortal Quickly, ‘Richard le Smert’
(M.), now ‘Smart,’ ‘Thomas Scharp,’ now ‘Sharp,’<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c009'><sup>[513]</sup></a> ‘Gilbert
Poygnant’ (A.), ‘Thedric le Witte’ (A.), now ‘Witt’
and ‘Witty,’ ‘Nicholas le Cute’ (A.), and ‘Ralph le
Delivre’<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c009'><sup>[514]</sup></a> (M.M.), argue well for the keen perceptions
and brisk habits of early days.<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c009'><sup>[515]</sup></a> The slang sense of
several of these, strangely enough, is but the original
meaning restored. ‘Witty’ arose when the word implied
keenness of intellect rather than of humour. Chaucer
thus speaks of ‘witty clerkes,’ using the latter word
too in a perfectly unofficial sense. Our numberless
‘Clarkes’ and ‘Clerkes,’ sprung from equally numberless
‘Beatrix le Clercs’ or ‘Milo le Clerks,’ may therefore
belong either to the professional class or to the
one we are considering. ‘William le Frek’ (M.) or
‘Ralph Frike’ (A.), now found as ‘Freak,’ ‘Frick,’ and
‘Freke,’ was a complimentary sobriquet implicative of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>bravery and daring even to rashness.<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c009'><sup>[516]</sup></a> Minot in his
political songs tells us in alliterative verse how the
doughty men of Edward the Third’s army were—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ful frek to fight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The old ‘William le Orpede,’ or ‘Stephen le Horpede,’
or ‘Peter Orpedeman’ denotes a disposition equally
stout-hearted.<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c009'><sup>[517]</sup></a> It is a term found in well-nigh all our
mediæval writers, and was evidently in common and
familiar use. Trevisa, in his account of the Norman
invasion, represents ‘Gurth’ as saying to Harold,
‘Why wilt thou unwary fight with so many orped
men?’ The monk of Glastonbury also, speaking of
Edward the Third’s expedition to Calais in 1350, relates
that he ‘towke with him the nobleis, and the
gentelles, and other worthi and orpedde menne of
armes.’ Our ‘Keats’ and ‘Ketts’ are the old ‘Walter
le Ket’ (G.) or ‘Osbert le Ket’ (J.), that is, the fierce,
the bold. Thus the cowherd in ‘William of Pelerne’
directs the child how to conduct himself—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When thou komest to kourt</div>
      <div class='line'>Among the kete lordes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>With these therefore we may associate ‘William le
Prew,’ now ‘Prew,’<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c009'><sup>[518]</sup></a> ‘Nicholas Vigerous,’ now found
also as ‘Vigors,’ ‘Helen Gallant,’ ‘John le Stallworth,’<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c009'><sup>[519]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>‘Thomas Doughtye,’ and ‘Robert le Bolde,’ all
still well-known names. ‘Prest,’ ‘Peter le Prest’
(M.), when not the archaic form of ‘Priest,’ is
of kin to the mountebank’s ‘presto,’ and means—quick,
ready. It was thus used till the seventeenth
century. ‘Kean,’ found as ‘Hugh le Kene’ or ‘Joan
le Kene,’ implies impetuosity. All these names speak
well for the pluck of our forefathers. They are found
with tolerable frequency, and naturally have not been
suffered to die out for lack of pride. The Norman
element, as we see, is strong in these chivalrous sobriquets.
Nor is it less so with many other terms of
no unpleasant meaning. Our ‘Purefoys’ or ‘Purfeys’
represent the <i>pure faith</i> of their countrymen.<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c009'><sup>[520]</sup></a> Our
‘Parfitts’ are but the quainter form of ‘Perfect.’<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c009'><sup>[521]</sup></a> Our
‘Bones,’ ‘Boons,’ and ‘Bunns’ are but variously corrupted
forms of ‘Duran le Bon,’ or ‘Richard le Bone,’
or ‘Alice le Bonne,’ or ‘William le Boon,’ equivalent
therefore to the earlier ‘Goods.’ ‘Bunker’ is similarly
but ‘Bon-cœur’ (‘William Bonquer,’ O.),<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c009'><sup>[522]</sup></a> our Saxon
‘Goodhart,’ and ‘Bonner,’ and the longer ‘Debonaire’
(‘Philip le Debeneyre,’ A.),<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c009'><sup>[523]</sup></a> our more naturalized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>‘Gentle’ (‘William le Gentil,’ M.), ‘Gentilman’
(‘Robert Gentilman,’ V. 1.),<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c009'><sup>[524]</sup></a> and ‘Curteis’ or ‘Curtis’
(‘Walter le Curteys’ J., ‘Richard le Curteis,’ C.),
Chaucer says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>All men holde thee for musarde,</div>
      <div class='line'>That debonaire have founden thee.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Amiable’ (‘Edward Amiable,’ Z., ‘Joan Amiable,’ Z.)
once existed, but in our registers, at least, that sweet
grace is now wanting. Equivalent to these latter, but
more Saxon in character, come our ‘Hendys’ or
‘Hentys’ (‘Thomas le Hendy,’ F.F., ‘John le Hendy,’
F.F.), a term found in all our early writers, and prettily
expressive of that which was gentle and courteous
combined. In the ‘Canterbury Tales’ the host reproves
the friar for lack of civility to one of the company by
saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>Sire, ye should be <i>hende</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>And curteis as a man of your estate,</div>
      <div class='line'>In company we will have no debate.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the Hundred Rolls we find a ‘William Hendiman’
occurring, and a ‘John Hende’ was Lord Mayor of
London in 1391. We have just mentioned the word
‘musarde.’ This reminds us of our ‘Musards’
(‘Malcolm le Musard,’ M.), who were originally of a
dreamy temperament.<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c009'><sup>[525]</sup></a> With our Saxon ‘Moodys’<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c009'><sup>[526]</sup></a>
(‘Richard Mody,’ G.), however, their title has fallen in
general estimation, the one now denoting, when used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>at all, a trifling, the other a morose and gloomy disposition.
Our ‘Sadds’ (‘Robert Sad,’ H.), too, from
being merely serious, sedate folk, have become sorrowful
of heart. Our great early poet speaks in the negative
sense of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>People unsad and eke untrue,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>that is, unstable and fickle. In a short poem, ascribed
to Lydgate, pointing out to children their course of
behaviour in company, we are told—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Who spekithe to thee in any maner place,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rudely cast not thyn eye adowne,</div>
      <div class='line'>But with a sad cheer look hym in the face.<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c009'><sup>[527]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Here of course sobriety of demeanour, rather than
sorrowfulness, is intended.<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c009'><sup>[528]</sup></a> That ‘Henry le Wepere’
(A.), and ‘Peter le Walur’ (A.), and ‘William le Blubere’
(A.), however, must have been of rueful countenance
we need not doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many changes too have passed over the names as
well doubtless as over the lives of another section of
our nomenclatural community. Our ‘Cunnings,’ we
will hope, dated from the time when he who <i>kenned</i>
his work well was so entitled without any suspicion of
duplicity.<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c009'><sup>[529]</sup></a> Very likely too our ‘Slys’ (‘John Slye,’
H.), and ‘Sleighs’ (‘Simon le Slegh,’ M.), ‘Slees’
(‘Isabella Slee,’ W.G.), and ‘Slemmans’ and Slymans’
were simply remarkable for being honestly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>dexterous in their several avocations.<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c009'><sup>[530]</sup></a> The ‘mighty
hand and outstretched arm’ of modern psalters was
once translated ‘a hand that was slegh.’ But as slyness
got by degrees but more and more associated
with the juggler’s sleight-of-hand tricks, the word fell
into disrepute. Such is the invariable effect of keeping
bad company. So late, however, as the seventeenth
century, one of our commonwealth poets was
not misunderstood when he spoke of one whom—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Graver age had made wise and sly.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>But the same predisposition to give ‘crafty’ and ‘sly’
and ‘cunning’ and ‘artful’ a dishonest sense has not
been therewith content, but must needs throw ridicule
upon the unsophisticated and artless natures of our
‘Simples’ (‘Jordan le Simple,’ A.), who would scarcely
feel complimented if their surname were to originate
in the present day.<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c009'><sup>[531]</sup></a> It is the same with our ‘Seeleys’
(‘Benedict Sely,’ D.) and ‘Selymans’ (‘George Selyman,’
D.), the older forms of ‘Silly’ and ‘Sillyman.’
Perhaps the phrase ‘silly lamb’ is the only one in
which we colloquially preserve the former idea of
‘silly,’ that of utter guilelessness. A ‘silly virgin’
with Spenser was no foolish maiden, but one helpless
in her innocence, and the ‘silly women’ Shakespeare
hints at in his ‘Two Gentlemen of Verona’ were but
inoffensive and unprotected females.<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c009'><sup>[532]</sup></a> ‘Sealey,’ ‘Silly,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>‘Sillyman,’ and ‘Selyman,’<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c009'><sup>[533]</sup></a> are all pleasant memorials
of the earlier sense of this word. Our ‘Quaints’ and
‘Cants’ have gone through a changeful career. They are
but the descendants of the old ‘Margaret le Coynte’ or
‘Richard le Queynte,’ from the early French ‘coint,’
neat, elegant. A shadow fell over it, however, and a
notion of artfulness becoming attached to the word,
to be quaint was to be crafty. Thus Wicklyffe, in his
translation of St. Mark’s account of Christ’s betrayal,
makes Judas say to the servants of the high priest,
‘Whomever I shall touch, he it is, hold ye him, and
lead him warily, or queintly.’ Thus, too, Lawrence
Minot, in his ‘Political Songs,’ tells us how—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The King of Berne was <i>cant</i> and kene,</div>
      <div class='line'>But there he lost both play and pride.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Strange to say, the word has well-nigh recovered its
original sense, betokening as it does a whimsical and
antique prettiness, if not the bare quality itself. Our
original ‘Careless’ (‘Antony Careless,’ Z.) was of
that happy disposition which the petty worries and
anxieties of life do not easily disturb, and, to judge
from our nomenclature, he forms but one of a large
band of cheery and easy-minded mortals. ‘Joyce,’
that is, ‘Jocose,’ when not a Christian name,<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c009'><sup>[534]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>‘Jolly’ must be set here, not forgetting the older and
prettier ‘Jolyffe’ (‘Henry Jolyffe,’ M.). In the
‘Miller’s Tale’ we are told of ‘Absolon,’ how that
when at eventide he had taken up his ‘giterne’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Forth he goth, jolif and amorous,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>to the window of his lady-love. ‘Gay’ (‘William le
Gay,’ R.), and ‘Blythe’ (‘Richard Blythe,’ Z.),<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c009'><sup>[535]</sup></a> and
‘Merry’ (‘William Merrye,’ Z.), or ‘Merriman’ (‘John
Meryman,’ X.), and ‘Gaillard,’ or ‘Gallard,’ or ‘Gayliard,’
or ‘Gaylord’ (‘Nicholas Gaylard,’ T., ‘William
Gallard,’ A., ‘Sabina Gaylard,’ H.), must all be placed
also in this category.<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c009'><sup>[536]</sup></a> I am not quite sure, however,
that the last are without a suspicion of that conviviality
which the buxom alewife was but too ready to bestow.
Our merry, versatile friend Absolon, whom I have just
referred to, among other his unclerkly arts, could play
on the ‘giterne’ as well as any ‘galliard tapstere.’
It seems to have been a common epithet, and would
readily find a place in our nomenclature, where it is
now firmly fixed. Our ‘Merryweathers’ (‘Andrew
Meriweder,’ A.) and ‘Fairweathers’ (‘John Fayrweder,’
A.)<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c009'><sup>[537]</sup></a> may seem somewhat difficult of explanation
to those who are unaware of the colloquial use
of these expressions in former times, ‘Mery-weder’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>especially being of the most familiar import. In the
‘Coventry Mysteries’ mention is made of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Bontyng the Brewster, and Sybyly Slynge,</div>
      <div class='line'>Megge Mery-wedyr, and Sabyn Sprynge.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>A happy sunshiny fellow would easily acquire the
sobriquet, and indeed both are found at a very early
day as such.<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c009'><sup>[538]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Not a few of those expressive terms of endearment,
some of which still flourish in our nurseries,
have made their mark upon our directories. We have
already alluded to our ‘Chittys.’ Our ‘Leafs’ represent
the old ‘Alice le Lef’ or ‘Matilda la Lef,’ beloved
or dear. We still use it in the well-nigh solitary
expression ‘lief as loth,’ but once it was in familiar
request. Robert of Brunne, in one of his stories,
says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Blessed be alle poor men,</div>
      <div class='line'>For God Almyghty loveth them:</div>
      <div class='line'>And weyl is them that poor are here,</div>
      <div class='line'>They are with God bothe lefe and dere.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Akin to this latter is ‘Love,’ which, when not the old
‘Robert le Love’ or wolf, is found in composition in
not a few instances. ‘Lovekin’ and ‘Lovecock,’ after
the remarks made in our first chapter on these terminations,
will be readily explainable; and ‘Truelove,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>‘Derelove,’ ‘Honeylove,’ and ‘Sweetlove’<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c009'><sup>[539]</sup></a> supply us
with expletives of so amorous a nature, we can but
conjecture them to have arisen through the too publicly
proclaimed feelings of their early possessors.
‘Newlove’ sounds somewhat inconstant, ‘Winlove’
attractive.<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c009'><sup>[540]</sup></a> ‘Goodlove,’ ‘Spendlove,’ and ‘Likelove,’
I believe, are now obsolete—a lot, too, which has
befallen the hardened ‘Lacklove,’ while our ‘Fulliloves’<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c009'><sup>[541]</sup></a>
still declare the brimming affection which
belongs to their nature—or at least did to that of
their progenitor. But even they are commonplace
beside our ‘Waddeloves’ or ‘Waddelows,’ the early
form of which, ‘Wade-in-love,’ would seem to tell of
some lovesick ancestor so helplessly involved in the
meshes cast about him as to have become the object
of the unkind sarcasms of his neighbours. A longer
and equally curious sobriquet abides in our ‘Wellbeloveds’
and ‘Wellbiloves.’ It is this latter form in
which it is found in the ‘Issues of the Exchequer.’<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c009'><sup>[542]</sup></a>
The French form of this was ‘Bienayme’ (‘William
Bienayme,’ A.), and to some settler of that name upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>our shores I suspect it is we owe our ‘Bonamys’
(‘William Bonamy,’ A.). I have just mentioned
‘Sweetlove.’ Associated with this are our simpler
‘Sweets,’ the nursery ‘Sweetcock,’ and ‘Sweetman,’<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c009'><sup>[543]</sup></a>
variously corrupted into ‘Sweatman,’ ‘Swetman,’ and
‘Swatman.’ ‘Bawcock’ and ‘Baucock,’ if not from
‘Baldwin,’ will be the endearing ‘beau-coq,’ once in
familiar use. Our ‘Follets,’ ‘Follits,’ and ‘Foliots,’
the last the original form, meant nothing more than
‘my foolish one’ or ‘fond one,’ and were very common.
They are but varied in the longer ‘Hugh
Folenfaunt,’ but I am afraid ‘Walter Fulhardy’ at
the same period is less complimentary. ‘Poppet,’ or
puppet, once the doll of English infancy, only remains
in the gilded and waxen manikins of the showman.
The surname, however, abides with us, as does also
‘Poplett.’ The old ‘fere,’ a companion, has left its
mark in our ‘Fairs.’ We all remember Byron’s
resuscitation of the word. In ‘Troilus and Cressida,’
mention is made of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Orpheus and Euridice his fere.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus ‘Playfair,’ once written ‘Playfere,’ is simply
‘playfellow,’ while the obsolete ‘Makefere’ (‘Hugh
Makefare,’ A.) would seem to be but intensive, ‘make’
being the invariable dress with olden writers of our
more familiar ‘mate.’<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c009'><sup>[544]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>There is something in obtrusive virtue that instinctively
repels us. We always like a man’s face to be
the index to the book of his heart, but when he would
seem to have carefully turned down each leaf for our
inspection, we get a revulsion of feeling—we like to
look out the page for ourselves. An elevated sense
of self-esteem was decidedly approved of by our forefathers,
but its too demonstrative exhibition soon
showed itself condemned in our ‘Prouds,’ ‘Prouts,’
‘Proudmans,’ ‘Proudloves,’ and ‘Proudfoots’ (‘Hugh
le Proud,’ A., ‘John le Prute,’ H., ‘George Proudelove,’
Z.Z., ‘Robert Prudefot,’ A.). A very interesting
name which has escaped the notice of surname hunters
is that of ‘Gerish’ or ‘Gerrish,’ both forms being
found in our modern directories. They are but the
truer representatives of the word ‘garish’ as used by
our later poets. Shakespeare’s Juliet, we may remember,
apostrophizes Night, and bids her, when Romeo
be dead, cut him into stars, and thus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>All the world will be in love with night,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pay no worship to the garish sun.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This splendidly describes the term, expressing as it
does that which glares ostentatiously and showily
upon the eye. Lydgate, far earlier, had used it thus,
in the form of ‘gerysshe;’ and such names as
‘Umfrey le Gerische’ or ‘John le Gerisse,’ found yet
more remotely, testify to its once familiar and frequent
use. We now talk of a prude as one who exaggerates
woman’s innate modesty of demeanour.
Formerly it denoted the virtue pure and untravestied.
The root, the Latin ‘probus,’ excellent, still remains
in our ‘Prudhommes’ (‘William Prodhomme,’ R.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>‘Peter Prodhomme,’ A.), with their more commonly
corrupted ‘Pridhams’ and ‘Prudames’ and ‘Prudens,’<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c009'><sup>[545]</sup></a>
a sobriquet which once referred simply to the honest
and guileless uprightness of their owners. How truly
do such words as these remind us of the poor estimate
man, after all, forms of himself. Man often rebels at
the declaration of Revelation that he is a fallen being,
and yet how strongly does he assert this fact in the
changes he himself has made in the meaning of words.
Our ‘Bauds’ (‘William le Baud,’ B., ‘Wauter le
Baud,’ M.) were once but the Norman equivalent of
our ‘Merrys’ already mentioned.<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c009'><sup>[546]</sup></a> Must lightness of
heart inevitably end in wanton levity? There was a
day when our ‘Parramores’ (‘Roger Paramour,’ M.;
‘Henry Parramore,’ Z.)<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c009'><sup>[547]</sup></a> were but the simple honest
lover of either sex, when our ‘Lemons,’ ‘Lemans,’
and ‘Lemmans’ (‘Eldred Leman,’ A., ‘John
Leman,’ M.) meant but the beloved one from ‘lief,’
‘dear.’ Both Chaucer and Piers Plowman employ the
term ‘lef-man’ or ‘leef-man’ as an expression of
endearment, with no thought of obloquy. Thus, too,
in the ‘Townley Mysteries,’ God is represented as
bidding Gabriel to go to Nazareth—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And hail that madyn, my lemman,</div>
      <div class='line'>As heyndly (courteously) as thou can.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Still, so early as the days of Gower, its corrupted
<i>leman</i> had become a sobriquet for one of loose, disorderly
habits.<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c009'><sup>[548]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c027'>(2) <i>Nicknames from Peculiarities of Disposition—Objectionable.</i></h4>
<p class='c018'>The mention of such names as ‘Baud,’ ‘Parramore,’
‘Leman’ or ‘Lemon,’ ‘Proud,’ ‘Proudman,’
and ‘Proudfoot,’ which we have charitably set in
the list of complimentary nicknames, as having,
perchance, risen at a time when the meaning of the
words conveyed a totally different idea from that
which they now convey, brings us to the category of
those which can scarcely seek any shelter of such a
kind. ‘Lorel,’ ‘Lurdan,’ and ‘Lordan,’ together with
the once familiar ‘losel’ and ‘losard,’ denoted a
waif, or stray, one who preyed upon society, exactly
identical, in fact, with the Latin ‘perditus.’ Thus
we find Herod, in the ‘Townley Mysteries,’ saying
to his officers—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Fie, losels and lyars, lurdans each one,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tratours and well worse, knaves, but knyghts none.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Cocke Lorelle,’ too, speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lollers, lordaynes, and fagot berers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Luskes, slovens, and kechen knaves.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>Cotgrave explains a ‘loricard’ to mean a <i>luske</i>, <i>lowt</i>,
or <i>lorell</i>. This <i>luske</i>, from the old French <i>lasque</i>, or
<i>lache</i>—slothful—though now wholly obsolete, did
much duty formerly. The adjective <i>luskish</i> and the
substantive <i>luskishness</i> are often found. In law <i>lache</i>
still survives as a term for culpable remissness. Our
‘Laches,’ ‘Lashes,’ ‘Laskies,’ and ‘Lusks,’ I am
afraid, therefore, come of but an indifferent ancestry.
Nor can anything better be said of our ‘Paillards’ or
‘Pallards.’ We still talk of a ‘pallet,’ the old ‘paillet,’
or straw bed, from ‘paille,’ chaff. A paillard was a
cant term for a lie-a-bed.</p>
<p class='c007'>By ‘ribaldry’ we always mean that which is foul-mouthed
in expression. This was ever its implication.
A ‘ribaud,’ or ‘ribaut’ belonged to the very scum of
society. He was a man who hung on to the skirts of
the nobility by doing all their more infamous work
for them. Chaucer, wishing to comprise in one
sentence the highest and the lowest grades of
society, speaks in his ‘Romance’ of ‘king, knighte,
or ribaude.’ ‘William le Ribote,’ therefore, mentioned
in the ‘Chapter House Records of Westminster,’
or ‘William Ribaud’ (W. 15), could not have
borne the best of characters, I am afraid. Although
not quite so degraded in the world’s esteem as
some of these last, we may here include our ‘Gedlings,’
reminiscences of the old ‘Gadling’ or ‘Gedling,’
one who gadded about from door to door to talk the
gossip and scandal—the modern tattler, in fact. Our
former ‘Gerard le Gaburs’ and ‘Stephen le Gabbers’
were equally talkative, if not such ramblers. As
overmuch talking and jesting always beget a suspicion
of overstretching the truth, so was it here.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>Wicklyffe uses ‘gabbing’ in the sense of lying, and
an old poem says:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the North of England, I need scarcely add, this is
the ordinary and colloquial sense of the term to the
present day. The name of ‘John Totiller’ might
well-nigh induce us to believe that teetotalism was not
unknown by that name at this period, but it is not so.
A ‘totiller’ was a ‘whisperer’ of secrets. In the ‘Legend
of Good Women,’ one says to the God of Love—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

</div>

<p class='c017'>The name of ‘Dera Gibelot’ or ‘John Gibbelote’<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c009'><sup>[550]</sup></a>
reminds us of a term now obsolete, but once familiar
as denoting a giddy, flighty girl.<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c009'><sup>[551]</sup></a> It is found in
various forms, the commonest being that of ‘giglot.’<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c009'><sup>[552]</sup></a>
Mr. Halliwell quotes an old proverb by way of adding
a further variation—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The smaller pesun (peas), the more to pott,</div>
      <div class='line'>The fayrer woman the more gylott.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I would, however, suggest this as but the pet form of
‘Gill,’ mentioned in my chapter on Christian names.
In either case the meaning is the same. An often
met with sobriquet in the fourteenth century is that of
‘Robert le Burgulion,’ or ‘Geoffrey le Burgillon,’ the
old term for a braggart. It is now, however, wholly
obsolete. ‘Robert le Lewed,’ or ‘William le Lewed,’
is also lost to our directories, and certainly would be
an unpleasant appellation in the nineteenth century.
Its general meaning four hundred years ago, however,
was its more literal one, that of simplicity or ignorance.
It is connected with our word ‘lay’ as opposed
to ‘cleric,’ and arose at a time when knowledge was
all but entirely in the hands of the clergy. Thus in
the ‘Pardoner’s Tale’ it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lewed people loven tales olde,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such things can they wel report and holde.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Such a name then, we may trust, implied nothing
beyond a lack of knowledge in respect of its possessor.
‘William Milksop,’ or ‘Thomas Milkesop,’ or ‘Maurice
Ducedame’ were but types of a class of dandified
and effeminate beings who have ever existed, but
even their names would be more acceptable than
those which fell to ‘Robert le Sot,’ or ‘Maurice Druncard,’
or ‘Jakes Drynk-ale,’<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c009'><sup>[553]</sup></a> or ‘Geoffrey Dringkedregges,’<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c009'><sup>[554]</sup></a>
or ‘Thomas Sourale.’<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c009'><sup>[555]</sup></a> It is evident that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>there were those who were disposed to follow the
dictate of at least one portion of the old rhyme—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Walke groundly, talke profoundly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drinke roundly, sleape soundly.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Ralph Sparewater,’ I fear, was a man of dirty habits,
while ‘John Klenewater’ was a model of cleanliness.</p>
<p class='c007'>But we have not yet done with sobriquets of an
unpleasant nature. Men of miserly and penurious
habits seem to have flourished in plentiful force in
olden days as well as the present. ‘Irenpurse’ figures
several times in early rolls, and would be a strong, if
somewhat rough, sarcasm against the besetting weakness
of its first possessor. ‘Lovegold’ is equally
explicable. ‘Pennifather,’ however, was the favourite
title of such. An old couplet says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The liberall doth spend his pelfe,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pennyfather wastes himself.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is found in the various forms of ‘Penifader,’ ‘Panyfader,’
and ‘Penifadir,’ in the fourteenth century.
‘Pennypurse,’<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c009'><sup>[556]</sup></a> ‘Halfpeny,’ and ‘Turnpeny’<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c009'><sup>[557]</sup></a> are met
with at the same time, and somewhat later on ‘Thickpeny.’
‘Broadpeny,’ ‘Manypenny,’ now corrupted
into ‘Moneypeny,’ ‘Winpeny,’ now also found as
‘Wimpenny,’ ‘Pinchpenny,’ with its more directly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>Norman ‘Pinsemaille,’ and ‘Kachepeny,’ with its
equally foreign ‘Cache-maille,’ are all also of the
same early date, and with one or two exceptions
are to be met with to this very day.<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c009'><sup>[558]</sup></a> It is a
true criticism which, as is noticed by Archbishop
Trench, has marked the <i>miserly</i> as indeed the emphatically
<i>miserable</i> soul. ‘Whirlepeny’ is now extinct,
but alone, so far as my researches go, existed
formerly to remind men that the spendthrift character
is equally subversive of the true basis of human
happiness.<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c009'><sup>[559]</sup></a> Several names combined with ‘peck’ and
‘pick,’ as ‘Peckcheese,’ ‘Peckbean,’ ‘Peckweather,’
and ‘Pickbone,’ seem to be expressive of the gluttonous
habits of the possessors, but it is possible
they may be but the moral antecedents of our modern
‘Pecksniffs’!<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c009'><sup>[560]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Our ‘Starks’ and ‘Starkies,’ if not ‘Starkmans,’
represent a word which can hardly be said to exist in
our vocabulary, since it now but survives in certain
phrases, such as ‘stark-mad,’ or ‘stark-naked.’ We
should never say a man was ‘stark’ simply. A
forcible word, it once expressed the rude untutored
nature of anything. Thus, on account of his unbridled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>passion, the Bastard King is termed in the Saxon
chronicle ‘a stark man, and very savage,’ while just
before he is asserted to be ‘stark beyond all bounds
to them who withsaid his will.’ Thus it will be akin
to such names as ‘Walter le Wyld,’<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c009'><sup>[561]</sup></a> or ‘Warin Cruel,’
or ‘Ralph le Ferce,’ or ‘John le Savage,’ or ‘William
le Salvage,’ or ‘Adelmya le Sauvage,’ or ‘William
Ramage.’ Chaucer speaks somewhere of a ‘ramage
goat.’</p>

<h3 class='c020'>III.—<span class='sc'>Miscellaneous.</span></h3>

<h4 class='c027'>(1) <i>Nicknames from the Animal and Vegetable Kingdom.</i></h4>
<p class='c018'>Mr. Lower, in his ‘English Surnames,’ gives a long
list of names from what he calls vegetable productions,
but, although he does not say so, I am confident
he would be the first to admit that the great
majority of those which he instances should really be
set among our local surnames. For example, he
includes ‘Cherry,’ ‘Broome,’ ‘Bramble,’ ‘Ferne,’
‘Holyoak,’ ‘Peach,’ ‘Rowntree,’ in this category.
While ‘Cherry’ and ‘Peach’ might possibly be
sobriquets of complexion, the manifest course is to
look upon them as of local origin. So persuaded am
I of this, after a long perusal of mediæval records,
that I shall notice but some half-dozen names from
the vegetable kingdom, and only those of which I can
find memorials in past registers. This is a place
which of all others might well tempt me to run riot
among our directories, and collect a curious list from
our present existing nomenclature; but I would even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>here persistently adhere to the idea with which I set
out, and to which I have mainly been true, viz., to
instance names about which I can speak somewhat
positively, because I have found them imbedded in
the nomenclature of the period in which surnames
had their rise. ‘Blanchflower,’ ‘Lilywhite,’ and ‘Boutflower’
I have already dealt with. ‘Robert Daisye’
occurs in the ‘Trial of Dame Alice Kyteler’ (Cam.
Soc.), ‘Nicholas Pescodde’ in the ‘Proceedings in
Chancery’ (Elizabeth), ‘Godfrey Gingivre’ (Ginger)
in the ‘Writs of Parliament,’<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c009'><sup>[562]</sup></a> ‘Geoffrey Peppercorn’
in the Hundred Rolls, ‘Robert Primerose’ and ‘Sara
Garlek’ in the ‘History of Norfolk’ (Blomefield),
and ‘Roger Pluckerose’ and ‘John Pullrose’ in a
Sussex Roll of 1296.<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c009'><sup>[563]</sup></a> I doubt whether more than
one or two of these can be said rightly to belong to
the nickname class. As sign-names—for I feel
assured they thus arose—they will have their place
in our second chapter on ‘Local Names.’<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c009'><sup>[564]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But when we come to the Animal Kingdom we
are on clearer and more definite ground. The local
class must undoubtedly embrace a large number of
these names, as such an entry as ‘William atte Roebuck’
(M.), or ‘Richard de la Vache’ (A.), or
‘Thomas atte Ram’ (N.), or ‘John de la Roe’ (O.),
or ‘Gilbert de la Hegle’ (A.), or ‘Hugh atte Cokke’
(B.), or ‘Walter de Whitehorse’ (C.), or ‘John atte
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>Gote’ (M.) dearly testifies. But on the other hand
we find a class, set by which the last is insignificant—a
class which has its own entries—‘William le Got’
(A.), ‘Katerina le Cok’ (B.), ‘Alicia le Ro’ (A.),
‘Philip la Vache’ (C.), or ‘Joachim le Ram’ (T.),
corresponding to the former, only differing in that
such entries are vastly more numerous and embrace a
wider range, taking in, in fact, the whole genus and
species that belong alike to ‘the fish of the sea, the fowl
of the air, the cattle, and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth.’ In dealing with this large
and varied assortment of sobriquets, I would say
then that, where there is no proof positive to the
contrary, the course is to survey a name of this class
as referable to three distinct origins, and I put them
in the following order of probability:—1. A nickname
taken from that animal whose generally understood
habits seemed to bear affinity to those of the nominee.
2. A local sign-name. 3. An heraldic device. With
these preliminary statements, let us proceed.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we find all the moral qualities seized upon to
give individuality to the possessors, so, too, we find
the names of animals whose peculiarities gave pretext
for the sobriquets pressed into the service of our
nomenclature. In our earlier Pagan history it had
been the wont of Saxon fathers to style their children
by the names of such beasts as from their nobler
qualities it was hoped the little one would one day
copy. The same fashion still existed, only that the
nickname as the exponent of popular feeling was
really more or less appropriate to him who was made
to bear it. In the latter case, too, it was the ridiculous
aspects of character that were most eagerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>caught at. Our general vocabulary is not without
traces of this custom. We still term a shrewish wife
a <i>vixen</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a she fox. Men of a vile, mean character
are rascals, <i>i.e.</i> lean deer; and rough boys are <i>urchins</i>,<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c009'><sup>[565]</sup></a>
a corruption of the old <i>herison</i>, or hedgehog. Applying
this to surnames, we come first to</p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>a</i>) <i>Beasts.</i>—Our ‘Bests,’ when not local, are but
the ‘Richard le Bestes’ or ‘Henry le Bestes’ of the
thirteenth century. Their superlative excellence is
therefore imaginary, I fear, but we may be permitted
to hope that they are what they appear. ‘Edith
Beest,’ in the sixteenth century, is nearer our modern
form. Our ‘Oliphants,’ ‘Olivants,’ and ‘Ollivants’
represent but the elephant, and owe their
origin, doubtless, to the huge and ungainly proportions
of some early ancestor. In the ‘Romance of
Alexander’ is a strange description of the fabled monoceros,
which would seem to have been a kind of potpourri
of all other beasts, for besides a tail like a hog,
tusks like a dog, and a head like a hart’s—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This sobriquet, in a day when size and strength went
for much, does not seem to have been thought objectionable,
for its owners have left issue enough to
prevent its ever falling into abeyance.<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c009'><sup>[567]</sup></a> Thus we see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>we may meet with elephants every day in our streets
without going to the Zoological Gardens for them.
Our ‘Lions’ (‘Richard Lion,’ V. 2) and ‘Lyons,’ when
not local,<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c009'><sup>[568]</sup></a> speak doubtless for the brave heart of
some early progenitor. Our ‘Bears,’ relics of ‘Richard
le Bere’ (A.) or ‘Lawrence le Bere’ (M.), as a reflection
upon a surly temper, would be less complimentary,
or perhaps the original nominee wore his hair
shaggy and long. A fierce disposition would meet with
rebuke or praise, as the case might be, in such a sobriquet
as ‘John Lepard,’ or ‘Tiger,’ now all but obsolete,
saving for our striped and liveried youths; or ‘Wolf’
(‘Elena le Wolfe,’ A., ‘Philip le Wolf,’ M.), with its more
Norman ‘Lupe’<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c009'><sup>[569]</sup></a> (‘Robert le Lupe,’ B.), or ‘Lovel’<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c009'><sup>[570]</sup></a> or
‘Love’ (‘Robert le Love,’ A.), the latter being in flat
contradiction to the usually ascribed instincts of the
animal. Timidity or reserve, or perchance fleetness
of foot, would soon find itself exalted in ‘Geoffrey le
Hare,’ ‘Reginalde le Raye,’ ‘Walter le Buk,’ ‘Hobart le
Hart,’ ‘Dorothie le Stagge,’ ‘Henry Rascal,’<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c009'><sup>[571]</sup></a> ‘William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>le Do,’ or ‘Alicia le Ro,’ the ancestors of our ‘Hares,’
‘Rays,’ or ‘Wrays,’ ‘Bucks,’<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c009'><sup>[572]</sup></a> ‘Harts,’ ‘Stags,’ ‘Does,’
or ‘Roes,’ of legal notoriety, and ‘Prickets.’ That
old spoiler of hen-roosts, the polecat, has left us in
‘Fitch’ and ‘Fitchett’ no very happy relationship of
ideas. Craftiness would be very properly stigmatised
in ‘Henry le Fox’ or ‘John le Tod,’ and a ‘John le
Renaud’ occurring in the Parliamentary Rolls reminds
us that some of our ‘Renauds’ and ‘Renards’ may
be more closely associated with this wily denizen of
our forest fastnesses than they think. The <i>badger</i> has
originated ‘Walter le Broc’ or ‘Henry le Brok’ (now
Brock); the <i>beaver</i> ‘John le Bever,’ or ‘John le Bevere’
(now Beaver).<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c009'><sup>[573]</sup></a> The <i>rabbit</i> gave us ‘Henry Cony’ and
‘John Conay;’ the <i>weasel</i> ‘Mathew le Martun’ (now
Marten); the <i>mole</i> ‘Walter le Want’ (now Want);
the nimble haunter of our forest boughs ‘Thomas le
Squyrelle’ (now Squirrell), and the <i>otter</i> ‘Alan Otere,’
or ‘Edward Oter’ (now Otter).</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor must we forget the farmyard and its accessories,
which, as we might readily presume, are well
represented. ‘Alice le Buie,’ or ‘William le Buie’
(now Bull), is a sobriquet which has now such a firm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>place as symbolic of our national character that we
need not show to what peculiarities of temperament
they owed their name. ‘Simon le Steer,’ ‘Peter le
Vache,’ with its Saxon ‘Thomas le Cu’ or ‘Ralph le
Cou,’ ‘Richard le Calf’<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c009'><sup>[574]</sup></a> ‘Godwin le Bulloc,’ ‘Peter le
Stot,’ ‘Roger le Colt,’ are all of common occurrence,
and still abide with us. ‘Roger le Mule,’ as representative
of obstinacy, we might have suspected, would

‘Robert le Veyle,’ or ‘William le Veel,’ now written
‘Veale,’ ‘Philip le Mutton,’ and ‘John le Bœuf,’ or
‘Robert le Bef,’<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c009'><sup>[576]</sup></a> carry us back to the day when these
several terms denoted the living animal. Thus, with
respect to the last, Burton in his ‘Anatomy,’ translating
Plautus, says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Like other cooks I do not supper dress,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That put whole meadows into a platter,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make no better of their guests than beeves,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With herbs and grass to feed them fatter.—p. 69.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Alongside our ‘Muttons’ we may place our ‘William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>le Lambs’ and ‘Richard le Lombs,’<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c009'><sup>[577]</sup></a> and if they were
remarkable for their meek disposition, playfulness, I
doubt not, was equally characteristic of our ‘Reginald
Kidds’ and ‘Cheevers,’ relics of the old ‘Henry le
Chivre’ or goat. I am afraid the connexion of ideas
that gave rise to such sobriquets as were represented
by ‘Alice le Hog,’ ‘John le Bacun,’<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c009'><sup>[578]</sup></a> ‘William le
Gryse,’ ‘Gilbert Galt,’ ‘Walter Pigge,’<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c009'><sup>[579]</sup></a> ‘Roger Sugge,’
‘Richard le Bor’ (Boar), ‘Richard Wildbore,’ ‘John
Pork,’ and ‘John Purcell’ (little porker, that is), is
not of the pleasantest—terms, too, as they are, all
familiar to our directories to this present day. Several
of these words are now colloquially obsolete. ‘Grice,’
I fancy, is one such. We still speak of the ‘griskin.’
Locally it comes in such names as ‘Grisdale’ and
‘Griswood.’ As a sobriquet of the animal, it was
quite familiar in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
Piers Plowman says—</p>

      <div class='line'>Goode gees and grys!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Sug’ was provincial for ‘sow,’ and comes in the local
‘Sugden’ mentioned in my first chapter. Richard
III. was sometimes styled the ‘Boar’ or ‘Hog.’ It
was in allusion to this that the rhyme got abroad—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

</div>

<p class='c017'>The first two referred of course to <i>Rat</i>cliffe and
<i>Cat</i>esby. But the mention of these reminds us of
our household pets and indoor foes. ‘Elias le Cat,’
or ‘Adam le Kat,’ or ‘Milo le Chat’ still boasts descendants,
and the same can be said for ‘Nicholas
Dogge,’ or ‘Eborard le Kenn,’ or ‘Thomas le Chen.’
The usual forms are Catt, Ken, and Kenn. In our
<i>kennel</i> we still preserve a memorial of this Norman-introduced
word. Our ‘Hunds’ and ‘Hounds’ are
but the old ‘Gilbert le Hund’ or ‘William le Hund,’
and carry us to the forest and the chase. The especial
bugbear of cat and dog alike found remembrance in our
early ‘Nicholas le Rat’ and ‘Walter le Rat,’ or ‘Ralph
Ratun,’<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c009'><sup>[580]</sup></a> and in ‘John le Mous,’ ‘Hugh le Mus,’ or
‘Richard Mowse.’ ‘Ratton,’ ‘Ratt,’ and ‘Mowse’ still
exist. With one more name we conclude. Through
Spain and the Moors of Barbary monkeys were early
introduced for the amusement of the English people.
In the ‘Miller’s Tale’ it is said of Alison—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>that is, she was wont to make a fool of him. The
sobriquet is found in such an entry as ‘John le Ape,’
registered in the Hundred Rolls, or ‘John Jackanapes,’
in the Parliamentary Writs.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>(<i>b</i>) <i>Birds.</i>—The surname that represents the genus
is ‘Bird,’ the name being met with as ‘John le Bryd’
or ‘David le Brid,’ a pronunciation still in vogue in
many parts of England. Falconry has given us many
sobriquets of this class. Accustomed as our fathers
were to seeing the fierce and eager instincts of the bird,
to nickname a man of rapacious and grasping habits
by such a term as ‘John le Kyte,’ or ‘William le
Hawk,’ or ‘Richard le Falcon,’ would be the most
natural thing in the world. And just as the difference
in breed and disposition in these birds themselves gave
rise to separate definitions, so an imagined resemblance
to these distinct qualities must have originated such
different names as ‘Muskett,’ ‘Buzzard,’ ‘Puttock,’<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c009'><sup>[582]</sup></a>
‘Goshawk,’ ‘Tassell,’ ‘Gleed,’ or ‘Glide,’<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c009'><sup>[583]</sup></a> and ‘Sparrowhawk,’
or ‘Spark,’ or ‘Sparke,’ as it is now more
generally spelt. So early as Chaucer, however, this
last was written ‘Spar-hawk,’<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c009'><sup>[584]</sup></a> and that once gained the
further contraction in our nomenclature became inevitable.
Thus was it with other birds. Did a man
develop such propensities as showiness, then he was
nicknamed ‘Jay;’ if pride, ‘Peacock’ or ‘Pocock,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>as it was once pronounced; if guile, ‘Rook;’ if pertness,
‘Pye,’ with its diminutive ‘Pyet’ or ‘Pyett;’ if
garrulity, ‘Parrott’ or ‘Parratt;’ if he was a votary
of song he was styled ‘Nightingale’ or ‘Lark,’ or in
its more antique dress ‘Laverock’ or ‘Woodlark,’ or
‘Finch,’ or ‘Bulfinch,’ or ‘Goldfinch,’ or ‘Chaffinch,’
or ‘Spink,’ or ‘Goldspink,’ or ‘Thrush,’ or ‘Thrussel,’
or ‘Cuckoo.’ If jauntiness displayed itself in his actions
he was nicknamed ‘Cock’ or ‘Cockerell’ or ‘Chauntecler;’
if homeliness, ‘Sparrow;’ if tenderness, ‘Pigeon’ or
‘Dove,’ and so on with our ‘Swans,’ ‘Herons,’ ‘Cootes,’
‘Gulls,’ ‘Storks,’ ‘Ravens,’ ‘Crows,’ ‘Speights,’ ‘Cranes,’
‘Capons,’ ‘Henns,’ ‘Chickens,’<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c009'><sup>[585]</sup></a> ‘Ducks,’ ‘Duckerells,’
‘Drakes,’ ‘Sheldrakes’ or ‘Sheldricks,’ ‘Wildgooses,’
‘Mallards’ (<i>i.e.</i> wild duck), ‘Gooses’ or ‘Goss’s,’<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c009'><sup>[586]</sup></a> ‘Greygooses,’
‘Goslings,’<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c009'><sup>[587]</sup></a> ‘Ganders,’ ‘Woodcocks,’ ‘Partridges,’
‘Partricks,’ ‘Pheasants,’ or ‘Fesants,’ as once
spelt, and ‘Blackbirds.’<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c009'><sup>[588]</sup></a> These are names ornithologically
familiar to us. Many a pretty name, however,
once on the common tongue but now obsolete, or well-nigh
so, still abides in our surnames. Thus our ‘Popjays’
still preserve the remembrance of the once
common <i>popinjay</i> or parrot, ‘the popinjay, full of delicasy,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>as Chaucer styles her.<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c009'><sup>[589]</sup></a> In ‘Culver’ or ringdove
we are reminded of the pathetic story of Philomine,
where the same writer likens her to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in7'>the lamb that of the wolf is bitten,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or as the culver, that of the eagle is smitten.<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c009'><sup>[590]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our ‘Ruddocks’ or ‘Ruddicks’ (‘Ralph Ruddoc,’ A.),
again, are but the old <i>ruddock</i> or robin-redbreast, ‘the
tame ruddock,’ as he is termed in the ‘Assembly of
Fowls.’ The hedge-sparrow still lives represented by
our ‘Pinnocks’ or ‘Pinnicks’ ‘John Pynnock’ (G.),
‘Richard Pinnoc’ (A.)—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thus in the pinnick’s nest the cuckoo lays,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, easy as a Frenchman, takes her flight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>So an old writer says. Our ‘Turtles’ (‘Roger Turtle’
D.) are but pleasant memorials of the bird that has
been so long emblematic of constancy, the dove; our
‘Challenders,’ if not a corruption of ‘Callender,’ are
representatives of the <i>chelaunder</i> or goldfinch, so often
mentioned by early poets; and in our ‘Woodalls,’
‘Woodales,’ and ‘Woodwalls,’ not to say some of our
‘Woodwells,’ we are but reminded of the <i>woodwale</i>,
the early woodpecker. Our ‘Rains’ are but the old
‘Robert or William le Rain,’ another term for the
same;<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c009'><sup>[591]</sup></a> while our ‘Stars’ and ‘Stares’ (‘Robert Stare,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>A.) carry us back to the day when the starling was
so familiarly styled. In the ‘Assembly of Fowls’
the author speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The false lapwing, full of trecherie,</div>
      <div class='line'>The <i>stare</i>, that the counsaile can beurie.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the ‘Romance of the Rose’ a list of birds is given
embracing many of the above—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For there was many a bird singing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Throughout the yard all thringing,</div>
      <div class='line'>In many places were nightingales,</div>
      <div class='line'>Alpes, finches, and wodewales,</div>
      <div class='line'>That in their sweet song delighten,</div>
      <div class='line'>In thilke (such) places as they habiten.</div>
      <div class='line'>There might men see many flocks</div>
      <div class='line'>of turtles, and laverocks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Chelaundres fele (many) saw I there,</div>
      <div class='line'>That very nigh forsongen were (tired of singing).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Every one of these birds so styled is still to be met
with in our directories, for even the <i>alpe</i> or bull-finch
is not absent. It is only in the investigation of subjects
like this we see how great are the changes that
creep over a people’s language. What a list of words
is this, which if uttered now would fall dead and
meaningless upon the ear of the listener, and yet they
were once familiar as household words.</p>
<p class='c007'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Fish.</i>—‘John le Fysche’ or ‘William Fyske’
have left descendants enough to prove that many a
Fish can live out of water, although much has been
advanced to the contrary. At a time when the
peasants lived daily on the products of the inland
streams and sandy sea-banks, and when the supply
was infinitely more plentiful than it is now, we can
easily perceive the naturalness of the sobriquets that
belong to this class. Terms that are all but obsolete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>to us now, were household words then. Hence it is
that we find our directories of to-day abounding with
such entries as ‘Whale,’<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c009'><sup>[592]</sup></a> ‘Shark,’ ‘Dolphin,’ Herring,’<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c009'><sup>[593]</sup></a>
‘Codde,’ ‘Codling,’ ‘Salmon,’<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c009'><sup>[594]</sup></a> ‘Trout,’ ‘Mackarel,’
‘Grayling,’ ‘Smelt,’ ‘Pilchard,’ ‘Whiting,’ ‘Turbot,’<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c009'><sup>[595]</sup></a>
‘Keeling,’ ‘Crabbe,’ ‘Chubb,’<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c009'><sup>[596]</sup></a> ‘Tench,’<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c009'><sup>[597]</sup></a> ‘Pike,’
and ‘Pickerel.’ ‘John Sturgeon’ is mentioned by
Foxe in his ‘Martyrology,’ under date 1541, and still
remains. The Hundred Rolls contain a ‘William
Lampreye.’ ‘Barnacle’ is still common, and ‘Mussell’
and ‘Spratt’<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c009'><sup>[598]</sup></a> are not unknown. But perhaps
the most curious of these early nicknames are those
belonging to ‘Matilda le Welke’ and ‘William
Welkeshorn.’ Probably they were notorious for a
weakness towards that mollusk, which is still eaten in
large quantities in some parts of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>d</i>) <i>Insects and Reptiles.</i>—This is not a large class.
The Hundred Rolls furnish us with a ‘Magge Flie’
and an ‘Oda<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c009'><sup>[599]</sup></a> Flie.’ The same records contain a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>‘Margaret Gnatte’ and a ‘William Gnatte.’ ‘Baldewin
Bugg’ (B.) and ‘Bate Bugge’ (A.) are also found, but
although the question has been asked—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>If a party had a voice,</div>
      <div class='line'>What mortal would be a Bugg by choice,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I fancy the cognomen is local, one of the endless
forms, like ‘Brough,’ ‘Burgh,’ ‘Burkes,’ of the old
‘Borough.’ ‘Roger le Waps’<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c009'><sup>[600]</sup></a> reminds us of the still
existing provincialism for wasp, and ‘William Snake’
or ‘John Frog’ would be as little acceptable.<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c009'><sup>[601]</sup></a> The
smallest and most repulsive insect we have, the parasitic
louse, is found in ‘Nicholas le Lus’ (J.), but our directories
have now got rid of it—an example that might
be followed with no small advantage in other quarters.</p>

<h4 class='c027'>(2) <i>Descriptive Compounds affixed as Nicknames.</i></h4>
<p class='c018'>But in an age like that of the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries we cannot imagine that society would
be merely required to come under a verbal castigation
such as, after all, did nothing more than strike off the
names of the animals that entered into Noah’s Ark.
To call a man a ‘wolf’ or a ‘bull’ or a ‘grayling’ or
a ‘salmon’ or a ‘peacock,’ after all, is not very
dreadful. Terms of a more compound form, sobriquets
more minutely anatomical, are also met with, the unpleasantness
of which is proved by the fact of so few
of them having come down to us, while not a small
portion, as not fit for ears polite, must be altogether
left in their obscurity. There are others, however,
of which none need to be ashamed. For instance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>the kingly denomination of ‘Quer-de-lyun’ (‘Ralph
Querdelyun,’ T., ‘William Querdelion,’ X.),<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c009'><sup>[602]</sup></a> found in
several lists, could not but be agreeable, while ‘Dan-de-lyun,’
or ‘lion-toothed’ (‘William Daundelyun,’ B.),
would be in thorough harmony with the spirit of the
age. ‘Colfox’ (‘Thomas Colfox,’ Z.), still existing,
would be less pleasant. The term ‘fox’ is supposed
in itself to be synonymous with deceit, but the intensive
‘col-fox’ or ‘deceitful-fox’ must have implied
duplicity indeed! Chaucer, in his ‘Nunn’s Story,’
speaks of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A col fox full of sleigh iniquity.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Clenehog’ (‘William Clenehog,’ A.) or ‘Clenegrise’
(‘Roger Clenegrise,’ A.) would seem to be a sarcasm
upon the dirty habits of its early owner, while
‘Piggesflesh’ (‘Reyner Piggesflesh,’ M.) or Hoggesflesh’
(‘Margery Hoggesflesh,’ Z.)<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c009'><sup>[603]</sup></a> is as obviously
intended to be a reflection upon the general appearance.
‘Herring’ (‘Robert Heryng,’ A.), already
mentioned, is not objectionable, but ‘Goodherring’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>(‘Adam Godharing,’ A.) and ‘Redherring’<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c009'><sup>[604]</sup></a> (‘William
Redhering,’ M.) are. ‘Fish’ one would not for a
moment find fault with, but few young ladies, I
imagine, would be found to face at the matrimonial
altar a ‘John Pourfishe’ (M.). Objection, too, if not
by the fair inamorata, yet by her parents, would be
raised, I suspect, to an alliance with a ‘Roger Feldog,’
or ‘Thomas Catsnose,’ or ‘William Cocksbrain,’ or
‘Robert Calvesmaw,’ or ‘Peter Buckeskyn,’ or ‘Arnulph
Dogmaw,’ or ‘Henry Crowfoot,’ or ‘Matthew Goosebeak,’
or ‘John Bullhead.’<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c009'><sup>[605]</sup></a> Talking of the last, however,
it is interesting to notice how much the bull has
entered into compounds of this kind. Thus we light
upon such names as ‘Walter Oyl-de-beof’ or ‘William
Oldbeof,’ that is, bull-eyed; ‘Ralph Front-de-bœuf,’
that is, bull-faced; ‘John Cors-de-bœuf’ or ‘Thomas
Cordebeofe,’ that is, bull-bodied; ‘John Queer-de-bœf,’
that is, bull-hearted, or ‘Amice le Wildebœf’ or
‘Nicholas Waldebeof,’ seemingly like ‘Wild-bore,’
referring to some wild untutored characteristics of the
bearer. In all these the genius of the age is quite
apparent, and probably not one was looked upon as
otherwise than complimentary. ‘William Scorchebouef’
was evidently some unlucky young kitchener
who had mismanaged his duties as spit-turner, but it
betrays the process by which the term ‘bœuf’ has
come into its present position of verbal usefulness.
In this light ‘Cors-de-bœuf’ also is further interesting
as reminding us that there was a time when ‘corpse’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>did not necessarily imply the inanimate frame.
‘Behold, they were all dead corpses,’ found in our
Authorized Version, was no tautology, it would appear,
even in the seventeenth century. Thus do changes
creep over the lives of words as well as men.</p>

<p class='c007'>We might fill a book with these descriptive
compounds—surnames so whimsical, so absurdly
humorous that they manifestly could not live. For
instance, we meet in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries with such a sobriquet as ‘William Hondeshakere,’
which no doubt spoke for the hearty goodwill
of its easy possessor. ‘Geoffry Chese-and-brede’
seems to refer to the peculiar taste of its owner,
while ‘Arnold Scutelmouth’ would be a sarcasm on
personal capacity for such things. ‘Alan Swet-in-bedde’
would not be an acceptable cognomen, nor
‘William Badneighbour,’ nor ‘Thomas Two-year-olde,’
nor ‘Geoffrey Dringkedregges,’ nor ‘Anna Hellicate’
(hell-cat).<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c009'><sup>[606]</sup></a> ‘Alice Gude-ale-house’ was evidently a
homely landlady, who kept her tavern in good repute
by assiduous attention and good-humoured ways.
‘William Kepegest’ would seem to bespeak the kindly
cheer of more private hospitality, while ‘John Drybread,’
if not stingy, was doubtless crusty. ‘John
Ratelle-bagge,’ or ‘John Leve-to-day,’ or ‘Serle
Go-to-Kirk,’ or ‘Thomas Horsenail,’ or ‘John Lightharness,’
or ‘Richard Myldew,’ or ‘John Buckleboots,’
or ‘Edward Tortoise-shell,’<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c009'><sup>[607]</sup></a> or ‘John Hornbuckle,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>while conveying no slight upon the character, would
be obnoxious enough as surnames. Our ‘Doolittles,’
‘Lovejoys,’ ‘Scattergoods,’ ‘Makepeaces,’ and ‘Hatewrongs’
belong to this same category. A large and
varied assortment of this class will be found in the
notes to this chapter, and to them I refer the reader.
They are of a class which were especially popular at
the time of which we are writing. Many of them are
used as expletives in the railing poets and writers of
the period. For instance, the author of ‘Cocke
Lorelle’s Bote’ speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>‘Slingthrift Fleshmonger,’</div>
      <div class='line'>Also ‘Fabian Flatterer,’ and ‘Cicely Claterer,’</div>
      <div class='line'>With ‘Adam Averus,’ flail-swinger,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ‘Francis Flaproach,’ ...</div>
      <div class='line'>With ‘Giles Unreste,’ mayor of Newgate,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ‘Lewis Unlusty, the leesing-monger.’</div>
      <div class='line'>Here is ‘Will Wily,’ the mill-pecker (thief),</div>
      <div class='line'>And ‘Patrick Peevish,’ hairbeater,</div>
      <div class='line'>With ‘Davy Drawlatch’<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c009'><sup>[608]</sup></a> of Rockingham.</div>
      <div class='line'>Also ‘Hick Crookneck,’ the rope-maker,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ‘Steven Measellmouth,’ mussell-taker,</div>
      <div class='line'>With ‘Gogle-eyed Thompson,’ shepster of Lynn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The above selection of fancy names will give us a
fair idea of the kind of sobriquet which went down
with the lower orders during the Angevine and
Plantagenet dynasties.</p>
<p class='c007'>But the largest branch of descriptive compounds
is yet to be mentioned. We find not a few instances
where names of simple relationship or occupation or
office, or even, we may add, of patronymic character,
having become compounded with adjectives expressive
of the feeling of those with whom the nominee
had to deal, naturally place themselves under this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>same category. These, so far as they have come
down to us, are generally of a favourable, or at least
harmless, description. Thus, to notice Christian
names first, this has especially been the case with
‘John.’ Probably as this sobriquet grew into favour
the practice became the means of distinguishing between
several of the same title. Thus, as I hinted in
my previous chapter, if John were doughty, he became
‘Prujean,’<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c009'><sup>[609]</sup></a> that is, preux-jean; if fat, ‘Grosjean;’ if
young, ‘Youngjohn;’<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c009'><sup>[610]</sup></a> if clownish, ‘Hobjohn;’ if big,
‘Micklejohn;’ if small, ‘Littlejohn,’<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c009'><sup>[611]</sup></a> or ‘Petitjean;’<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c009'><sup>[612]</sup></a>
if of a sunburnt countenance, ‘Brownjohn;’<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c009'><sup>[613]</sup></a> and if
comely or well proportioned, ‘Properjohn;’ thus preserving
a once familiar sense of ‘proper,’ which we
may meet with in such an olden phrase as a ‘proper
knight,’ or in our present Authorized Scripture
Version, where our translators make St. Paul speak of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>Moses in his infancy as a ‘proper child.’<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c009'><sup>[614]</sup></a> Lastly, we
have the estimable ‘Bonjohn,’ the origin, I doubt not,
of ‘Bunyon’ and ‘Bunyan,’ the familiar bearer of the
latter form of which we shall all doubtless admit to
be well worthy his name. It is happy chance that
when we speak, as we often do, of ‘<i>good John</i> Bunyan,’
we simply give him a reduplication of that very
title which none more richly merits than he. In 1310
there was a ‘Jon Bonjon’ in London, and still earlier
than this a ‘Durand le Bon Johan’ figures in the
Hundred Rolls.<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c009'><sup>[615]</sup></a> Several others we may mention,
more Saxon in their character, and all long obsolete,
save one. Indeed, I doubt not they died with their
original possessors. These are ‘Robert Good-robert’
(P.) and ‘Richard White-richard’ (J.), ‘William Holy-peter’
(A.) ‘William Jolif-will’ (A.) (<i>i.e.</i> ‘Jolly-Will’),<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c009'><sup>[616]</sup></a>
and ‘William Prout-pierre’ (M.). ‘William Goodhugh’
(M.), however, has contrived to hold his own,
unless, as Mr. Lower thinks, it belongs not to this
category, but one I have already surveyed, that regarding
complexion. Its early form of ‘Godhewe’
would seem perhaps to favour his notion. Names of
this class, however, are rare. When we come to occupation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>the instances are much more common.
Thus if we have ‘Husband,’ who doubtless owes his
origin to his economical rather than his marital position,
we have, besides, ‘Younghusband’—in his day,
I dare say, a somewhat precocious youth—the now
obsolete ‘Goodhusband;’ if ‘Skinner,’ then ‘Langskinner;’
if ‘Wright,’ then ‘Longwright’ or ‘Longus-Faber,’
as it is Latinized in our rolls; if ‘Smith,’ then
‘Gros-smith,’ that is ‘big-smith,’ or ‘Wild-smith’ or
‘Youngsmith;’ or if ‘Groom,’ then ‘Good-groom’<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c009'><sup>[617]</sup></a> and
‘Old-groom.’ If we have ‘Swain,’ we had also
‘Goodswain,’ or ‘Brownswain,’ or ‘Madswain,’ or
‘Summerswain,’ or ‘Cuteswain,’ or ‘Colswain’ (that
is, deceitful swain, or ‘Littleswain;’ if ‘King,’<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c009'><sup>[618]</sup></a> then
‘Littleking,’ ‘Coyking,’ ‘Brownking,’ ‘Whiteking,’
and ‘Redking;’ if ‘Hine,’ or ‘Hyne,’ or ‘Hind,’
a peasant somewhat similar to Swain, then also
‘Goodhyne;’ if ‘Bond,’ then ‘Youngbond;’ if
‘Knave’ or servant, then ‘Smartknave,’ ‘Whiteknave,’
‘Brownknave,’ and ‘Goodknave,’ the latter a
strange compound to modern ears;<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c009'><sup>[619]</sup></a> if ‘Clerk,’ then
‘Bonclerk,’ ‘Beauclerk,’ ‘Goodclerk,’ ‘Mauclerk,’<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c009'><sup>[620]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>‘Redclerk;’<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c009'><sup>[621]</sup></a> if ‘Page,’ then ‘Littlepage’<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c009'><sup>[622]</sup></a> and
‘Smallpage,’ and to put it here for convenience, ‘Lawpage;’
if ‘Wayt,’ a ‘watchman,’ then ‘Smartwayt,’
‘Stertwait’ (active, on the alert), and ‘Goodwayt;’ if
‘Man’ or ‘Mann,’ a relic of the old ‘le Man’ or
menial, then also ‘Goodman,’ a term, however, which
became early used of any honest householder.<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c009'><sup>[623]</sup></a> ‘Le
Mayster’ or ‘Master’ was common enough, but I am
sorry to say I have not lighted upon a ‘Goodmayster’
as yet. Thus ‘Fellowe’ also, or ‘Fellowes,’ as we now
have it, is met by ‘Goodfellow’ and ‘Longfellow;’
‘Child’ by ‘Goodchild’ and the obsolete ‘Evilchild;’
‘Son’ by ‘Littleson’ and ‘Fairson;’ ‘Sire’ by ‘Littlesire’
and ‘Fairsire;’ ‘Nurse’ by ‘Goodnurse,’ and
‘Fowl’ by ‘Goodfowl.’ Norman equivalents for these,
however, were not wanting. ‘Goodfellow’ had its
mate in ‘Boncompagnon,’ ‘Goodbody’ in ‘Bonecors,’
‘Goodwait’ in ‘Bonserjeant,’ ‘Goodclerk’<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c009'><sup>[624]</sup></a> in ‘Bonclerk,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>and ‘Goodman’<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c009'><sup>[625]</sup></a> in ‘Bonhomme’ (our present
‘Bonham’)<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c009'><sup>[626]</sup></a> and ‘Prudhomme’ or ‘Pridham.’ ‘Evilchild’
found itself face to face with ‘Malenfant,’
‘Littlesire’ with ‘Petitsire,’ ‘Goodchild’ with ‘Bonyfant,’
‘Bonenfant,’ or ‘Bullivant,’ as we now have it,
and ‘Godson’ or ‘Goodson,’ it may be, with ‘Bonfils’
or ‘Boffill.’ We have still ‘Clerk,’ but ‘Bonclerke,’
if not ‘Beauclerk,’ is obsolete; ‘Squier,’ but ‘Bonsquier’
has disappeared; ‘Chevalier’ also thrives,
while ‘Bonchevalier’ is extinct. In some cases the
simple and the compound forms are both wanting.
It is so with our former ‘Vadlets’ and ‘Bonvalets,’
our ‘Vileins,’ ‘Beauvileyns,’ and ‘Mangevileyns’
(scabby), our ‘Queynts’ and ‘Bonqueynts,’ and our
‘Aventures’ and ‘Bonaventures,’ the latter sobriquet
evidently given to one who had acquitted himself well
in some mediæval joust or tournament. It is found
in several records. Piers Plowman uses the term
simple, when he speaks of Faith crying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As dooth an heraud of armes,</div>
      <div class='line'>When aventrous cometh to justes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Christian,’ which may be but the proper name, still
lives, though ‘Bonchristien’ is gone; and ‘Count,’
too, lingers, ‘Boncount’ being obsolete. Sometimes,
strangely enough, the French idiomatic compounds
got literally translated into Saxon, resulting in terms
of utterly different meaning. Thus, as I have already
shown, ‘Beaupere’ met face to face with ‘Fairsire,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>‘Beaufiz’<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c009'><sup>[627]</sup></a> with ‘Fairchild,’ and ‘Beaufrere’ with ‘Fairbrother.’
But this bare and naked translation into
the vernacular seems to have been a general practice.
The Norman ‘Petyclerk,’ for instance, was
speedily met by ‘Smalwritere,’ ‘Blauncpayne’ by
‘Whitbred,’ and ‘Handsomebody,’ over which much
obscurity has lingered, is, I have no hesitation in asserting,
a directly Saxonised form of ‘Gentilcors,’ a
name not unfrequently met with at this date.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the names I have mentioned above, however,
are, strange to say, being reproduced in the
present day after a curious fashion. The multiplication
of forenames has been the primary cause of this.<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c009'><sup>[628]</sup></a>
In many cases these, by becoming as it were adjectives
to the surname, form sobriquets no less ludicrous
and striking than those which for that very reason
so soon became obsolete. Thus such a combination
as ‘Choice Pickrell’ is exactly equivalent to ‘Goodherring’
just alluded to. ‘Arch Bishop’ restores the
archiepiscopal name which fell into abeyance in the
twelfth century; while such other names as ‘Perfect
Sparrow,’ ‘Savage Bear,’<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c009'><sup>[629]</sup></a> ‘Royal King,’ ‘Sing Song,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>‘Ivory Mallet,’<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c009'><sup>[630]</sup></a> ‘More Fortune,’<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c009'><sup>[631]</sup></a> ‘Christmas Day,’
‘Paschal Lamb,’ ‘River Jordan,’<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c009'><sup>[632]</sup></a> or ‘Pine Coffin,’<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c009'><sup>[633]</sup></a>
may be met by designations equally absurd, if less
travestied. These, of course, must be attributed to
mere eccentricity on the part of parents, rather than
to accident. Combinations of this kind, however,
have arisen of late years through another circumstance.
It not unfrequently occurs that through
certain circumstances two family names are united.
Thus we have such conjunctions as ‘Burdett-Coutts’
or ‘Sclater-Booth.’ Speaking of these reminds me of
a story I have heard anent a combination of this kind.
A certain gentleman, it is said, of the name of Colley,
in bequeathing in his will a considerable estate to a
friend of the name of ‘Mellon,’ made it the condition
of his acceptance that the legatee added his benefactor’s
name to his own. His friend had no objection
to the property, but when he found that his acquiescence
in the terms imposed would make him
‘Mellon-Colley’ to the end of his days, he considered
the matter afresh and declined the offer.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>
  <h4 class='c027'>(3) <i>Nicknames from Oaths, Exclamations, Street-cries, and Mottoes.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>(<i>a</i>) <i>Oaths.</i>—A remarkable, though not a very
large, batch of surnames is to be referred to perhaps
the most peculiar characteristic of all—that of the use
of profane, or at least idle oaths. The prevalence of
imprecations in mediæval times was simply extraordinary.<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c009'><sup>[634]</sup></a>
If the writings of that period bear but the
faintest comparison to the talk of men, their conversation
must have been strangely seasoned. For instance,
in the ‘Canterbury Tales’ we find introduced
without the slightest ceremony such oaths as ‘for
Cristes passion,’ ‘by Goddes saule,’ ‘for Cristes
saule,’ ‘by Goddes dignitee,’ ‘Goddes banes,’<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c009'><sup>[635]</sup></a>
‘Cristes pein,’ ‘Goddes love,’ ‘Goddes hate,’ ‘Cristes
foot,’ ‘God me save,’ and the more simple ‘By-God,’
or ‘Parde’ or ‘Pardieu.’ That they are mostly meaningless
is their chief characteristic. ‘John Pardieu’ in the
Rolls of Parliament will represent our many ‘Pardews,’
‘Pardows,’ ‘Pardoes,’ and ‘Pardies;’ and although I
have given a different origin in my second chapter,<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c009'><sup>[636]</sup></a> I
may mention ‘Alina le Bigod’ (J.), or ‘John le Bygot’
(M.). ‘Barbara Godselve’<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c009'><sup>[637]</sup></a> (F.F.), ‘Richard Godesname’ (X.),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>‘Richard Godbeare’ (Z.), (now ‘Godbeer,’
‘Godbehere,’ and ‘Goodbeer’), ‘Roger Godblod’ (E.)
(God’s blood), ‘Alicia Godbodi’ (A.) (God’s body),
seem all to be representative of familiar imprecations.</p>

<p class='c018'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Mottoes.</i>—In many cases we can scarcely doubt
that ensigncy has had something to do with the
origin of our surnames. Edward III. at a tournament
had his trappings embroidered with the couplet—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hay, hay, the white swan,</div>
      <div class='line'>By God’s soule I am thy man.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Godsol’ and ‘Godsoule’ formerly existed, and may
have so risen. Among other names of this class may
be mentioned ‘Janett God-send-us’<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c009'><sup>[638]</sup></a> (W. 13), ‘Roger
Deus-salvet-dominas,’<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c009'><sup>[639]</sup></a> ‘John God-me-fetch,’ ‘John
Dieu-te-ayde,’ ‘John Flourdieu,’ ‘Henry Grace-dieu,’<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c009'><sup>[640]</sup></a>
‘Henry Warde-dieu,’ ‘John Depart-dieu,’ and ‘John
Angel-dieu.’<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c009'><sup>[641]</sup></a> From the escutcheons of their wearers
these would easily pass on to the men themselves
who first bore them as surnames.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Exclamations.</i>—‘Peter Damegod’ (M.) and
‘John Domegode’ (O.), meaning literally ‘Lord God,’
represent a once favourite expletive.<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c009'><sup>[642]</sup></a> We are here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>reminded that there was a time when ‘Dame,’ from
<i>dominus</i> and <i>domina</i> alike, was applied to either
sex. One or two exclamations of less objectionable
import are also to be met with. ‘William Godthanke’
(A.) seems but a reversal of our ‘Thank God,’ while
‘Ralph Godisped’ (A.), fossilised in our ‘Goodspeeds,’
may represent ‘God-speed-thee.’<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c009'><sup>[643]</sup></a> ‘Richard Farewel’
(A.), ‘Simon Welfare’ (A.), ‘John Welcome’ (Z.Z.),
‘William Adieu’ (M.), would possess affixes readily
given for their kindly and oft utterance. Our ‘Rummelows,’
‘Rummileys,’ and ‘Rumbelows,’ without dispute,
represent but the old well-known cry of ‘Rombylow’
or ‘Rummylow,’ the sailor’s ‘Heave-ho’ of
later days. In the ‘Squire of Low Degree’ it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Your mariners shall synge arow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hey how, and rumbylow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The ancestor of those who bear the name was doubtless
a sailor at some period of his career.<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c009'><sup>[644]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>(<i>d</i>) <i>Street-cries.</i>—The calls of hawkers could not
of course escape the good-humoured raillery of our
forefathers. We find ‘Robert Freshfissh’ (X.) to
have been a fishmonger, and ‘John Freshfisch’ is set
down in the Rolls of Parliament. About the same
time ‘Margaret Fressheharyng’ dwelt in the Metropolis.
‘Agnes Godefouele’ (A.) and ‘Basilia Godfowele’
(A.) were manifestly poultry-women, for even
the most respectable occupations were then, as I have
already shown, itinerant. But perhaps the most
curious thing of all is to notice the price-calls that have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>found themselves inscribed in our registers. The
larger sums will have a different origin, but I place
them here for convenience sake. The Writs of Parliament
give us a ‘Robert Peny;’ the ‘Wills and Inventories’
(Surt. Soc.), a ‘Thomas Fourpeni;’ the
Hundred Rolls, a ‘John Fivepeni;’ the ‘Cal.
Rot. Originalium,’ a ‘Thomas Sexpenne;’ the ‘Yorkshire
Wills and Inventories’ (Surt. Soc.), a ‘John
Ninepennies;’ and the Hundred Rolls, a ‘Fulco
Twelpenes.’<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c009'><sup>[645]</sup></a> ‘James Fyppound’ (Fivepound) is mentioned
in ‘Materials for History of Henry VII.’ So
early as 1342 we find ‘John Twenti-mark’ to have
been Rector of Risingham (Norfolk, 1, 64); while
‘William Hunderpound’ was Mayor of Lynn Regis in
1417 (do. viii. 532). This latter may be a translation
of a Norman sobriquet, for ‘Grace Centlivre’ and
‘Joseph Centlivre’ are set down in a Surrey register
of the same date. (‘Hist. and Ant. Survey,’ Index.)
In both cases, I doubt not, the nickname was acquired
from the peculiarity of the source whence the income
was derived. ‘Centlivre’ existed in the eighteenth
century at least, for it was Mrs. Centlivre who wrote
the ‘Platonic Lady,’ which was issued in 1707.
‘Thomas Thousandpound,’ the last of this class, appears
in the ‘Wardrobe Accounts’ (Edward I.), and
concludes a list as strange as the most ardent ‘lover
of the curious’ could desire.<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c009'><sup>[646]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>Looking back, however, upon these earlier names,
how many varied and conflicting qualities of the
human heart do they all reflect, some honourable,
some harmlessly innocent, the greater part, I fear, discreditable.
Of all how much might be said, but I
refrain, lest I be liable to a charge of acting contrary
to the spirit of the kindly old adage, ‘de mortuis nil
nisi bonum’—‘speak no evil of the dead.’ Thus telltale,
however, are our surnames, and if it be no pleasant
task to expose the weaknesses and the frailties
of them whose bones have so long ere this crumbled
into decay, still we may comfort ourselves with the
remembrance that their names, with many others I
could have adduced had space permitted, offer no
kind of reflection upon their present possessors. It is
not unseldom we see the bearer of a worthy name
dragging the same through the dust and mire of an
ignoble life. It is amongst these names of somewhat
unsavoury origin we oftentimes meet with the best,
and the truest, and the noblest of our fellows.</p>

<p class='c033'>In collecting materials for a History of Costume of more importance
than the little Handbook which has met with so much
favour as an elementary work, I was not only made aware of
my own deficiencies, but surprised to find how much more vague
are the explanations and contradictory the statements of our best
authorities than they appeared to me when, in the plenitude of my
ignorance, I rushed upon almost untrodden ground, and felt bewildered
by the mass of unsifted evidence and unhesitating assertion
which met my eyes at every turn.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the forty years which have elapsed since the publication
of the first edition of my ‘History of British Costume’ in ‘The
Library of Entertaining Knowledge,’ archæological investigation
has received such an impetus by the establishment of metropolitan
and provincial peripatetic antiquarian societies, that a flood of
light has been poured upon us, by which we are enabled to re-examine
our opinions, and discover reasons to doubt, if we cannot
find facts to authenticate.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the former greatly preponderate is a grievous acknowledgment
to make after assiduously devoting the leisure of half my life
to the pursuit of information on this, to me, most fascinating subject.
It is some consolation, however, to feel that, where I cannot
instruct, I shall certainly not mislead, and that the reader will
find, under each head, all that is known to or suggested by the
most competent writers I am acquainted with, either here or on
the Continent.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_710'>710</span>That this work appears in a glossarial form arises from the
desire of many artists who have expressed to me the difficulty they
constantly meet in their endeavours to ascertain the complete form
of a garment, or the exact mode of fastening a piece of armour, or
the buckling of a belt, from their study of a sepulchral effigy or a
figure in an illumination; the attitude of the personages represented
or the disposition of other portions of their attire effectively preventing
the requisite examination.</p>

<p class='c007'>The books supplying any such information are very few, and
the best confined to armour or ecclesiastical costume. The only
English publication of the kind required, that I am aware of, is
the late Mr. Fairholt’s ‘Costume in England’ (8vo. London, 1846),
the last two hundred pages of which contain a glossary; the most
valuable portion whereof are the quotations from old plays, mediæval
romances, and satirical ballads containing allusions to various articles
of attire in fashion at the time of their composition. Twenty-eight
years have expired since that book appeared, and it has been
thought that a more comprehensive work on the subject than has yet
issued from the English press, combining the pith of the information
of many costly foreign publications, and in its illustrations keeping
in view the special requirements of the artist to which I have alluded,
would be, in these days of educational progress and critical inquiry, a
welcome addition to the library of an English gentleman.</p>

<div class='footnote c035' id='f1'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Proofs of the ignorance of authors and authoresses in regard to
surnames might be cited to any extent. The novel of <i>Aurora Floyd</i> is
a case in point. When we read the account there given of the ancestry
of the heroine, her Scotch descent, &amp;c., and then remember that Floyd
is but a corruption (through the difficulty of pronunciation) of the Welsh
Lloyd, we may well be pardoned a smile. Walter Scott would never
have so committed himself.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f2'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The following extract will show how patronymic surnames
changed at first with each successive generation:—‘Dispensation for
Richard <i>Johnson</i>, <i>son</i> of <i>John</i> Richardson, of Fishlake, and Evott
daug: of Robert Palmer, who have married, although related in the
fourth degree. Issued from Rome by Francis, Cardinal of St.
Susanna, 30th March, 13th Boniface IX. (1402).’ Test. Ebor. vol. iii.
p. 318.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f3'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus we find in the <i>Manchester Directory</i> for 1861, ‘Napoleon
Bonaparte Sutton, tripe-seller,’ and ‘Napoleon Stott, skewer-maker.’
Born, doubtless, during the earlier years of the present century, their
parents have thus stamped upon their lives the impress of that fearful
interest which the name of Napoleon then excited.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f4'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘Ithell,’ though now unknown, was once a familiar Christian
name. ‘Evan ap Ithell,’ Z.; Jevan ap Ithell, Z.; Ann Ithell, H.H.;
Ithell Wynn, A.A.I. ‘Bethell’ as a surname is still sufficiently common
in the Principality to keep up a remembrance of the fact.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f5'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘Howel’ or ‘Hoel’ was at one time a favourite Welsh baptismal
name. We have a ‘Howel le Waleys,’ that is, ‘Howel the Welshman,’
or, as we should now say, ‘Howell Wallace,’ mentioned in the
Parliamentary writs of 1313. As I shall show by-and-by, our
‘Powells’ may in some cases, at least, be of more English origin.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f6'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘Ot’ and ‘et’ sometimes became ‘elot’ and ‘elet’—‘Robert
Richelot’ (w. 15) (from Richard); Crestolot de Eratis (d. d.) (from
Christian); ‘Walter Hughelot’ (A.); ‘John Huelot’ (A.) (from Hugh);
Constance Hobelot (A.) (from Hobbe); ‘Hamelet de la Burste’ (Cal.
and Inv. of Treasury); ‘Richard son of Hamelot’ (A.A. 2) (from
Hamon). ‘Hamlet’ and ‘Hewlett’ are the commonest representatives
of this class in our existing nomenclature. As a diminutive suffix ‘let’
is found in such words as ‘leaflet,’ ‘bracelet,’ ‘hamlet,’ or ‘ringlet.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f7'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The French have, among others of this class, ‘Guyon,’ ‘Philipon,’
‘Caton’ (Catharine), and ‘Louison.’ Sir Walter Scott, ever most accurate
in his nomenclature, makes ‘Marthon’ to be domestic to Hameline
de Croye (Quentin Durward). None of these reached England.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f8'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As a Christian name, however, fashion has again brought it into
favour. While the memories that cluster round the name of the Iron
Duke live, ‘Arthur’ can never die. Indeed, there are as many ‘Arthur-Wellesleys’
now as there were simple ‘Arthurs’ before the battle of
Waterloo.</p>

‘Bateman,’ ‘Coleman,’ ‘Sweteman.’ Such entries as ‘Bateman Gille,’
‘Thomas Batemanson,’ ‘Richard Batmonson,’ ‘Coleman le Hen,’
‘Swetman fil. Edith,’ or ‘Sweteman Textor,’ are not unfrequent.
‘Tiddeman’ is of the same class. ‘Tydeman le Swarte’ and ‘Tiddeman
Bokere’ both occur in the fourteenth century. All the above are
firmly established as surnames. Having referred to ‘Sweetman,’ I may
add that ‘Sweet’ itself was a baptismal name. ‘Swet le Bone’ (A),
‘John Swetson’ (‘State Papers, Domestic, 1619–1623’), ‘Adam
Swetcoc’ (A).</p>

‘Ulchetel’ was registered as ‘Ulkell’ and ‘Ulchel’ (W. 12, pp. 19,

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r62'>62</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We must not forget a once familiar corruption of the diminutive
‘Juliet’ into ‘Juet.’ Such entries as ‘Juetta fil. William’ (T.),
‘Richard fil. Juetta’ (T.), ‘William Juet’ (A.), or ‘Christopher Jewitson’
(Z.) are very common in the rolls of the xiiith and xivth centuries.
This, in the North, was pronounced ‘Jowet,’ hence such entries as
‘Roger fil. Jowettæ’ (T.), ‘Jowet Barton’ (W. 11), and our surname
‘Jowett.’ ‘Jewitt’ also exists. One of this name was a jockey in the
Derby of 1874.</p>

whanne he hath founde one precious margarite, he wente and solde alle
thingis that he hadde and boughte it.’—Matt. xiii. 45, 46. Foxe too,
in his ‘Book of Martyrs,’ quotes Isidorus to the effect that John the
Apostle ‘turned certain pieces of wood into gold, and stones by the
seaside into margarites.’—Vol. i. p. 28, edit. 1844.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r64'>64</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘Barbara,’ as another Greek virgin-martyr, may be set beside
Margaret. ‘Barbe’ was the French form. As we shall see by-and-by,
our ‘Simbarbes’ and ‘Simbarbs’ hail from St. Barbe in Normandy.
(Jordan de St. Barbe, M., Thomas Seyntbarbe, B.) The Hundred
Rolls register three pet forms as surnames. ‘Bertol Babbe,’ ‘John Barbot,’
and ‘Nicholas Barbelot.’ The latter belongs to the class in <i>elot</i> of
which ‘Robelot,’ ‘Hewelot’ and ‘Hamelot’ are instances.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f65'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r65'>65</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The various forms of the diminutive are found as Christian names
in the ‘Manor of Ashton-under-Lyne’ (Ch. Soc.), where occur such
entries as ‘Magot, that was wife of Richard,’ ‘Merget of Staley,’
‘Marget of Stanly,’ ‘Mergret, that was wife of Hobbe.’—pp. 96–7.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f66'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r66'>66</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since writing the above, I find several notices in Brand’s ‘Popular
Antiquities’ which, while corroborating the view I have taken, shed a
clearer light as to Maid Marian’s other sobriquet of ‘Malkin.’ In his
allusion to the Morris dances, he quotes Beaumont and Fletcher as
saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Put on the shape of order and humanity,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or you must marry Malkin, the May-lady.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus far, then, adding this to Mr. Halliwell’s quotation, we find that
Maid Marian for several centuries was also ‘Malkin.’ But we must
remember that it was during this very period that Robin Hood and his
mistress were popularly believed to be Robert, Earl of Huntingdon, and
Matilda, daughter of Lord Fitzwalter. That the May Queen, therefore,
should be occasionally styled ‘Malkin’ will appear natural enough if
we accept the view of the origin of that name as recorded in the text.
But it may be asked how did she get the sobriquet of ‘Marian’?
Perhaps Mr. Steevens’s quotation from an old play, ‘The Downfall of
Rob. Earl of Huntingdon,’ dated 1401, may help us—</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r67'>67</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It has been thought by some that our ‘Makins’ and ‘Makinsons’
are from Matthew, and not in any way connected with feminine nomenclature.
This may be so, for although there is the entry ‘Maykina
Parmunter’ in the Parliamentary Rolls, there is also ‘Maykinus

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r68'>68</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thomas Mawdeson (F. F.) would lead one to suppose that
Mawson was a direct corruption. It may be so, but ‘Maw’ itself
seems to have existed as a pet form of Maud. In the ‘De Lacy Inquisition’
(1311) there occurs ‘Richard, son of Mawe, for 25 acres, etc.’—p.
10 (Chelt. Soc.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f69'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r69'>69</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The preceding paragraphs will sufficiently answer, I doubt not,
the questions of correspondents in ‘Notes and Queries,’ as to whether

</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f70'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r70'>70</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Elizabeth came into use too late to leave any mark upon our surnames.
I have not come across, to the best of my remembrance, a
single instance in any record earlier than the fifteenth century. ‘Bess,’
or ‘Bessie,’ was the first pet name formed from it, and this very probably
began to grow into favour about the time of Elizabeth Woodville’s
marriage. With the proud imperious Queen Bess, however, came in
every conceivable variety that could be played upon the name, ‘Betsey,’
or ‘Betsy,’ ‘Betty,’ ‘Eliza,’ ‘Lizzie,’ and ‘Libbie’ being the favourites.
The first ‘Bessie’ I find is that of ‘Bessye Tripps,’ 1558; the first
‘Betty’ being that of ‘Bettye Sheile,’ 1580, both being in a Newcastle
will. Betty for two centuries was, perhaps, the form most in favour in
aristocratic circles. How fickle is fashion! It is entirely tabooed there
in the nineteenth.</p>

speaks of them as the aforementioned ‘Evotam et dictum Willielmum
Rowlay.’ (Test. Elor., vol. i. p. 145–6. Surt. Soc.) An old London

Palestine</i>, page 333, he says: ‘The name of the river has in Italy
and Spain, by a natural association, been turned into a common Christian
name for children at the hour of baptism, which served to connect
them with it.’ Judging by existing traces merely, I doubt whether
the practice was quite so familiar in those countries as our own.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r82'>82</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We cannot but believe, however, that in many instances these
two are but the offspring of ‘Alice,’ at this period one of the most
popular of female names. Nor must we forget that Alison was itself a
personal name, this being the Norman-French pet form of Alice, after
the fashion of Marion, Louison, Beaton, etc. We are all acquainted
with the ‘Alison’ of the ‘Canterbury Tales’—</p>

This name is found in our more formal registers in such an entry as
‘Alison Gelyot.’ (Parl. Rolls.) With regard to ‘Alis’ and ‘Elis,’ and
‘Alison’ and ‘Elison,’ recorded in the text, I may remind the reader that
A and E were all but convertible letters with the Normans. One of
their favourite female names, that of ‘Aveline,’ is found equally often as
‘Eveline,’ and in the form of ‘Evelyn’ it came down to the distinguished
writer of the seventeenth century. ‘Arnold’ and ‘Ernold,’ ‘Americ’

also the French diminutive. ‘Alan Fitz-Pirot was a benefactor to St.
Alban’s Monastery.’ (See Clutterbuck’s <i>Hertford</i>, Appendix, vol. i.)

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r94'>94</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lord Macaulay has noticed this. Speaking of the Old Testament,
and in respect of the old Puritans, he says: ‘In such a history it was not
difficult for fierce and gloomy spirits to find much that might be distorted
to suit their wishes. The extreme Puritans, therefore, began to
feel for the Old Testament a preference which, perhaps, they did not
distinctly avow even to themselves, but which showed itself in all their
sentiments and habits. They paid to the Hebrew language a respect
which they refused to that tongue in which the discourses of Jesus and
the epistles of Paul have come down to us. They baptized their children
by the names, not of Christian saints, but of Hebrew patriarchs
and warriors.’—(<i>Hist. Eng.</i> ch. 1.)</p>

Buckingham by Walter Scott, in his <i>Peveril of the Peak</i>. A Mrs.
Cresswell, who had borne anything but a creditable character, bequeathed
10<i>l.</i> for a funeral sermon, in which nothing ill-natured was to
be said of her. The duke wrote the following brief but pointed discourse:
‘All I shall say of her is this: she was born <i>well</i>, she married
<i>well</i>, she lived <i>well</i>, and she died <i>well</i>; for she was born at “Shad-well,”
married to “Cress-well,” lived at “Clerken-well,” and died in

of the old ‘Derneden’—that is, the secret or secluded den. The
Hundred Rolls give us, for instance, a ‘Ralph de Derneden.’ This
word ‘dern’ was then in the most familiar use. Thus, in ‘Cursor
Mundi,’ mention is made of ‘a mountain dern.’ Chaucer speaks of
‘derne love,’ and Piers Plowman of ‘derne usurie.’ Our ‘Durnfords’
but represent such an early entry as ‘Robert de Derneford;’ and of
names now obsolete, we might instance ‘Dernehus,’ found also in the
same roll as the above. Our ‘Dernes’ simple probably originated in
the reticent and cautious disposition of their first ancestor. We may
take this opportunity of noticing that ‘Dibdin’ is but ‘Deepden.’ One
of our older rolls has a ‘Randolph de Depeden.’</p>

<p class='c017'>Relics of this are found in such an entry as ‘Nicolas Conyng’ or ‘Peter
Conyng,’ though now met with as ‘Coney.’ More local registrations,
such as ‘Thomas de Conyton,’ ‘John de Conington,’ ‘John de
Conyngsby,’ or ‘Walter de Cunnyngby,’ are still familiarised to us
in ‘Conington’ and ‘Coningsby.’ The North English form was
‘Cuning,’ whence the ‘de Cunnyngby’ above instanced and our modern

<div class='footnote c035' id='f134'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r134'>134</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In two different rolls we come across such cognomens as ‘Osbert
Diabolus’ and ‘Roger le Diable.’ These are very likely but relics of
early jesting upon the local forms mentioned in the text. A ‘Thomas
de Devyle’ occurs in the Parliamentary Rolls, while in the Writs of the
same we find a ‘John de Evylle.’ The former instance, again, may be
but a sarcastic reduplication of the prefix. Dean Milman, quoting the
author of <i>Anglia Judaica</i>, tells the following story, which shows how
early this name had been so played upon:—‘A certain Jew travelling
towards Shrewsbury in company with Richard Peche, Archdeacon of
Malpas, in Cheshire, and a reverend dean whose name was “Deville,”
was told amongst other things, by the former, that his “jurisdiction
was so large as to reach from a place called Ill Street all along till they
came to Malpas, and took in a wide circumference of country.” To
which the infidel, being more witty than wise, immediately replied: “Say
you so, sir? God grant me then a good deliverance! For it seems I
am riding in a country where Sin (Péché) is the archdeacon, and the
Devil himself the dean; where the entrance into the archdeaconry is in
Ill Street, and the going from it Bad Steps (Malpas).”’ (<i>History of
Jews</i>, vol. iii. p. 232.)</p>

locally in various parts of Western Europe. I have included ‘Champion’
with the others because, though sometimes a combative sobriquet,
it is as often found to be the mediæval form of the local term, ‘Champian’
and ‘Champain’ being other modes of spelling the same to be
met with at this period. Thus we find such double entries as ‘Katerina
le Champion’ and ‘Roger de Champion.’ Our present Authorised
Version uses the word twice, as in Deut. xi. 30:—‘Are they not on the
other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land
of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal,
beside the <i>plains</i> of Moreh?’ In the various translations of this passage
almost all the above modes of spelling have been used.</p>

the king’s foot, in gratitude for so great a favour, he made answer in the
English tongue, “Ne se, by God”—“Not so, by God”—upon which
the king and his courtiers, deriding him, and corruptly repeating his
answer, called him “Bigod,” from whence the Normans are to this day
termed “Bigodi.”’</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r161'>161</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Hundred Rolls we find a ‘Will Litleking.’ This sobriquet
would readily attach to one such feast-appointed monarch whose diminutive
stature would but impart additional merriment to the occasion.
‘Roger Wyteking’ (<i>Testa de Neville</i>) would owe his <i>nom-de-plume</i> to
the dress he wore. It is to such an institution as this, again, we must
ascribe the origin of such names as ‘Reginald Kyngessone,’ and perchance
‘Richard Kyngesman,’ both found in the Hundred Rolls also.
That our ‘Kings’ are but a memorial of the festivities of our forefathers,
is an undoubted fact. Every great nobleman had not merely a professed
‘fool,’ but at particular seasons a ‘King of Misrule.’ This ‘king’
initiated and conducted the merry doings of Christmastide, and was a
proper officer. Besides the ‘King of Misrule,’ there were also the
‘King’ and ‘Queen’ of each village enthroned on May morning,
who would be sure to keep their regal title through the year at least.
Thus, among the twenty or thirty families that comprised the manor of
Ashton-under-Lyne in 1422, we find ‘Hobbe the King,’ while a festival
to be held there in that year is to be under the supervision of ‘Margaret,
widow of Hobbe the King, Hobbe Adamson, Jenkin of the
Wood, Robert Somayster (Sum-master), etc.’ (<i>Three Lancashire Documents.</i>
Cheth. Soc.) ‘We, Adam Backhous and Harry Nycol, hath

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r162'>162</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Ordinary was any ecclesiastic judge, the bishop himself, or his
deputy. Thus, in a statute of Edward III., dated 1341, it is said:—‘Item,
it is accorded and assented that the king and his heirs shal
have the conisance of the usurers dead, and that the Ordinaries of Holy
Church—<i>les Ordinares de Seinte Esglise</i>—have the conisance of usurers
in life, as to them appertaineth, to make compulsion by the censures of
Holy Church for the sin,’ &amp;c. (<i>Stat. Realm</i>, vol. i. p. 296.) We still
call the gaol chaplain the <i>ordinary</i> who conducts the condemned prisoner
to the scaffold and reads the appointed service. The Parliamentary
Writs give us a ‘John Ordeiner’ and a ‘Stephen Ordinar.’</p>

<div class='footnote c035' id='f163'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r163'>163</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The term ‘poll’ for the head, was far more familiar to our forefathers
than to ourselves, as such terms as ‘poll-tax,’ or ‘going to the poll,’
testify. It was in great favour for nickname purposes, and beside the
one in the text gave rise to such sobriquets as ‘ranti-poll,’
<i>i.e.</i>, boisterous fellow; ‘doddy-poll,’ or ‘doddy-poul,’ as
Latimer spells it, <i>i.e.</i>, blockhead; or ‘withy-poll,’ <i>i.e.</i>,
spoiled one. The latter was a term of endearment, and as such would not
be resented. Hence it is found twice as a surname:—‘Poule Withipoule,
taillour’ (<i>Rutland Papers</i>, Cam. Soc.); ‘Edmund Withipole’
(<i>State Papers, Domestic</i>).</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r165'>165</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We have the surname of ‘Outlawe,’ or ‘Outlaghe,’ figuring in
several rolls, and that of ‘Felon,’ or ‘le Felun,’ in at least one. These
would be both unpleasant names to bear, perhaps more so then than
now. A ‘felon’ was one who had, by court adjudicature, and for some
specific crime, forfeited all his property, lands, or goods. An ‘outlaw’
was one who had been cited to judgment for some misdemeanour, and
by refusing to make an appearance had put himself out of the protection
of the law. Thus, Robin Hood was an outlaw. ‘Adam Outelaw’ signs
ordinances of Guild of St. John Baptist, West Lynn, 1374. (<i>English
Gilds</i>, p. 102.) This name, strange to say, lingered on to within
the last two hundred years, a ‘Thomas Outlaw’ being found in a college
register for 1674. (Vide <i>Hist. C. C. Coll. Cam.</i>) In 1661, too, ‘Ralph
Outlaw’ was rector of Necton in Norfolk. (<i>Hist. Norf.</i>, vi. 55.)</p>

had his place in the baronial household as the superintendent of the
mess-making department. From his knowledge of herbs thus acquired
he evidently came to be looked upon in a medicinal capacity. Thus the
term came to be used synonymously with ‘apothecary.’ In the <i>Archæologia</i>
(vol. xxii) we find it recorded that one of the horses connected
with the household of James V. of Scotland was called ‘le Pottinger’—‘uno
equo pharmacopile, vulgo le Pottinger.’ In an old university
record, dated 1439, I find, too, a certain ‘Ralph Prestbury’ mentioned
as sworn to keep the peace towards ‘Thomam Halle, potygare, alias
chirurgicum.’ (<i>Mun. Acad. Oxon.</i>, p. 523.) Probably, however, it
was the lowly herbalist, rather than the professional druggist, who

met with in <i>Munimenta Academica</i> (Oxon.) p. 525, under the date 1441.
That this was a common term at that university we may prove from an
indenture found in the same book, dated 1459, in which are mentioned
‘catours, manciples, spencers, cokes, lavenders, &amp;c.’ (P. 346.) It
may be interesting to some to state that to this day this is the term for
the chief cook in several of the colleges.</p>

existed in the term, ‘Hoarder,’ <i>i.e.</i> one who stored up. ‘Richard le

Bedel Hall, one of the numerous smaller establishments at Oxford in

Court till late in the sixteenth century. In England they did not make
their appearance till 1608, and it is said they were there the immediate
result of the published travels of Thomas Coryat, who visited Italy
in that year. I am sorry to say that I cannot find any instance of
‘Spooner’ in our earlier archives. Foxe mentions, in his <i>Martyrology</i>,

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r210'>210</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We find the modern spelling of this sobriquet little varied from
that of the fifteenth century. An act, passed in 1463, to restrain excess
in apparel, makes a proviso in favour of ‘Hensmen, Heroldes, Purceyvantes,
Swerdeberers, as Maires, Messagers, and Minstrelles.’ (<i>Stat.
Realm</i>, vol. ii. p. 402.) Sir Harris Nicolas says: ‘No word has been
more commented upon than “Henchmen,” or “Henxmen.” Without
entering into the controversy, it may be sufficient to state that in the
reign of Henry VIII. it meant pages of honour. They were the sons
of gentlemen, and in public processions always walked near the
monarch’s horse.’ (<i>Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VIII.</i>, p. 327.)</p>

but another name for the steward or steward’s lieutenant. It was one
among other duties of this officer to set down not merely the courses as
they came in, but what and how much was placed before each, so that
all might tally with the sum allowed for culinary expenses. This is
alluded to in the <i>Boke of Curtasye</i>. Speaking of the steward’s offices in
the hall, it says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r217'>217</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The old Norman word was either ‘healme’ or ‘heaume.’ The
more ordinary term for the former now is ‘helmet.’ Hall, writing of
the Battle of Bosworth Field, after mentioning the fact of the armies
coming in sight the one of the other, says: ‘Lord, how hasteley the
souldyoures buckled their healmes, how quickly the archers bent their
bowes and frushed their feathers, how redely the bilmen shoke their

<div class='footnote c035' id='f218'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r218'>218</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is thought by several writers that the ‘Sworder’ was one who
performed feats of jugglery, the sword, after the fashion of the times,
forming the most important feature in his art, his hairbreadth tricks
being especially popular with the country people. It is quite possible
this may be its real origin. The only early instances I find of the name
are in the Parliamentary Writs and the Parliamentary Rolls, where are
recorded respectively a ‘John le Serdere’ and a ‘Henry Swerder.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f219'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r219'>219</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In Mr. Riley’s interesting <i>Memorials of London</i> there is recorded
not merely a ‘Richard le Kissere,’ but the occupation itself is clearly
marked in the entry, ‘Walter de Bedefont, kissere.’ (P. xxii.) There
need be no hesitation in accepting the statement that the ‘kisser’ was
thus occupied. It is merely spelt according to the then pronunciation.
In the <i>Statutes of Arms</i> it is said: ‘And no son of a great lord, that is
to say, of an earl or baron, shall have other armour than mufflers and
cuishes (“ne seit arme fors de mustilers e de quisers”).’ (<i>Stat. of Realm</i>,

Aspe,’ which had been of late entirely in the hands of the manufacturers
of arrows, ‘so that the Flecchers thorough the Reame may sell their
arrowes at more esy price than they were wonte to doo.’ The aspe was

could have in his own wood ‘ayries of hawks, sparrowhawks, faulcons,
eagles, and herons.’ (25 Edward I. c. 13.) By a statute passed in the
reign of Edward III., anyone who found a strayed hawk or tercelet was
to bring it to the sheriff of the county, through whom proclamation to
that effect was to be made in the towns. If the finder concealed the
bird, he was rendered liable to two years’ imprisonment. (34 Ed. III.

‘Richard Stonhewer,’ ‘Richard le Blockhewere,’ or ‘William
Flesschewer.’ This last may be but a corruption of ‘Flesher.’
After the prevailing fashion of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the
termination ‘ster’ was sometimes added instead of ‘er.’ Thus, in the
Chester Play we find the procession joined by the ‘Hewsters.’ Richard
le Hewster was sheriff in 1382. (Ormerod’s <i>Cheshire</i>, vol. i. 302.)</p>

<div class='footnote c035' id='f270'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r270'>270</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So late as 1541 we have such an entry as this: ‘Item, to John
Glassier for mendynge the wyndowe over the gallery, v<i>s.</i> viii<i>d.</i>’ (<i>Churchwardens’
Accounts, Ludlow</i>, p. 8, Cam. Soc.) A little later we find:
‘Item, to John Pavier for his labour, iii<i>d.</i> Item, for pavinge before
the gate, i<i>d.</i>’ (P. 10, do.) These are both interesting instances of
the late formation of surnames. Both evidently took their second
sobriquets from their occupation. ‘Pavier,’ I need hardly say, still
exists.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f271'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r271'>271</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since writing the above I find my latter conjecture to be confirmed.
Miss Meteyard, in her interesting life of Josiah Wedgwood, says:
‘The surname of ‘Tellwright,’ or ‘Tilewright,’ which, variously spelt,
fills a considerable portion of the parish register of Burslem down to a
late period of the eighteenth century, and is still common, is curious
evidence of the antiquity of the tilewright’s craft in this locality....
Every worker in its clays became a tilewright, whether he moulded
tiles or formed the homely pipkin or porringer, the slab-like dish or ale-vat
for the hall.’ (Vol. i. p. 93.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f272'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r272'>272</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In an inventory of household furniture, dated 1559, we have
amongst other articles, ‘One trussin bed with a teaster of yealow and
chamlet, one old arke, old hangyers of wull grene and red, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>’
(<i>Richmondshire Wills</i>, p. 135.) Another writer, twenty years earlier,
relating the contents of the ‘mylke howse,’ includes ‘an arke, a tube
(tub), a stande, a chyrne.’ (P. 42, do.) The earliest instance of the
surname I have yet met with is found in the same book, where, in
a will dated 1556, the testator bequeaths a sheep to ‘Henry Arkwright.’
(Do. p. 155, note.) Both the ark itself and the trade are of
North English origin.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f273'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r273'>273</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘Shuxsmith’ seems but a corruption of this. The intermediate
form is found in <i>Wills and Inventories</i> (Ch. Soc.), in the names of
‘Margerie Shughsmythe’ and ‘Henry Shughsmythe.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f274'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r274'>274</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘Buckler’ may be mentioned here. ‘John le Bockeler’ (A.),
‘Richard Bokeler’ (Z).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f275'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r275'>275</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With our ‘Locksmiths’ we must, of course, ally our ‘Lockmans,’
‘Lockyers,’ and ‘Lockers,’ and perchance ‘Lookers.’ We find a
‘Henry le Lokier’ set down in the Hundred Rolls, and in an old
Oxford record, dated 1443, there occurs the name of ‘Robert Harward,
loker,’ who doubtless found plenty of employment in providing for the
security of the various rooms attached to the different colleges and halls.
(<i>Mun. Acad. Oxon.</i>, p. 535.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f276'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r276'>276</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are several single representatives of occupations connected
with the smith which I have not mentioned in the text, not having met
with any trace of their continued existence amongst us. Thus, in the
<i>London Memorials</i> we find a ‘John Chietesmyth,’ which, so far, I have
found to be wholly unintelligible. I must say the same in regard to
‘Cokesmyth,’ occurring in the <i>Boldon Book</i>. ‘John Rodesmith,’ if not
a scribe’s error for ‘Redesmith,’ would be the manufacturer of the then
familiar ‘rood’ or ‘rode,’ the cross which we occasionally may see still
standing beside our old turnpikes. ‘William Watersmith,’ it is quite
reasonable, may have spent his energies on water-wheels and such other
machinery as helped to turn the mill. All these are now, and probably
were then, almost immediately obsolete. On the other hand, we have
‘Wildsmith’ existing in our midst, only one representative of which am
I able to discover in our olden records. It is just possible that, like the
obsolete ‘Youngsmith,’ it originally referred to the characteristics of the
man as well as of his trade.</p>

<div class='footnote c035' id='f277'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r277'>277</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The roads between Cumberland and Northumberland were of the
roughest and most dangerous character till the seventeenth century, when
General Wade, in the course of his progress against the rebels, laid
down some of a better kind. The following couplet has been handed

Corser, he who acted as the king’s agent in regard to the purchase of
horses. A certain ‘Johannes Martyr, corsere,’ occurs in an old Oxford
record, dated 1451. (<i>Mun. Acad. Oxon.</i>, p. 616.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f279'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r279'>279</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus, in the <i>Itinerarium of Richard I.</i>, it is said that, after a conflict
with the Greeks, ‘Rex igitur cum persecutus esset imperatorem
fugientem lucratus est runcinum vel jumentum sacculo retro sellam
collocato,’ &amp;c.—P. 191. We may quote, also, the <i>Wardrobe of
Edward I.</i>: ‘Magistro Willelmo de Apperle, pro restauro unius runcini
favi appreciati pro Roberto de Burton, valletto suo, &amp;c., 8<i>l.</i>’—P.

</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f281'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r281'>281</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is confirmed by the existence of ‘Chartman,’ more modernly
‘Cartman.’ A ‘John Chartman’ was rector of Sedistern, Norfolk, in
1361. (Blomefield.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f282'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r282'>282</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The following entry is found in the <i>Issue Rolls</i>: ‘To Master
William la Zousche, clerk of the king’s great wardrobe in money, paid
to him by the hands of John le Charer, for making a certain chariot for
the use and behoof of Lady Eleanor, the king’s sister, by writ of liberate
containing 1000<i>l.</i>’ (<i>Issues of the Exchequer</i>, 6 Ed. III.) Capgrave,
too, may be cited. Writing of Helianore, daughter to the King of
France, when given to Richard of England, he says, under date 1394:
‘She was ful scarsly viii yere of age, but she brought oute of Frauns xii
chares ful of ladies and domicelles.’ Mr. Way says that in 1294 the
use of this vehicle by the wives of wealthy citizens in Paris had
become so prevalent that it was forbidden them by an ordinance of
Philippe le Bel.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f283'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r283'>283</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘Couchman’ and ‘Coachman’ must be set here. ‘Aug. 4,
1640. Dorothy Coachman, daughter of Tilney Coachman, buried’
(Smith’s Obituary, p. 17). This Tilney is recorded elsewhere as ‘Tilney
Couchman.’ Mr. Wedgewood says, ‘Coach. The Fr. <i>coucher</i>
became in Dutch <i>koetsen</i>—to lie; whence “koetse,” a couch—a litter,
a carriage in which you may recline, a <i>coach</i>’ (p. 159). The twofold
spelling of this Tilney’s name is thus explained. Hence, too,
‘Couchmen’ represents but the older form of ‘Coachman’—Richard
Couchman, Z., ‘William Cowcheman,’ EE., John Coacheman, Z.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f284'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r284'>284</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the <i>York Pageant</i> the ‘Sellers’ and the ‘Satellers’ went together.
The latter, doubtless, made satchels, and would differ little
from the ‘bourser’ or ‘pouchemaker’ of that period. In the <i>Prompt.
Parv.</i> we find ‘Sele, horsys harneys.’ A ‘John de Essex, Selmakere,’
occurs in the <i>London Records</i>, 1310, and a ‘Robert Newcomen,
Sealmaker,’ 1311. (Riley’s <i>London</i>, pp. xxii., xxx.) The latter,
doubtless, was a maker of seals, like some of the ‘le Selers’ of this
period. I have mentioned them elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f285'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r285'>285</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While, as I have just said, in the <i>York Pageant</i> it is the ‘Satellers’

upholder was simply an undertaker. He may have been this, but it is
evident it was but a subordinate branch of his occupation. We find in

<p class='c015'>The following entry from the <i>Exchequer Issues</i> will give the

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r366'>366</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is only right to say that there seems to have been a term
‘coucher’ to imply one who resided in certain towns for purposes of
trade of a somewhat doubtful character. In this sense it was but a
French sobriquet, meaning in English ‘a lurker.’ A statute of Edward
III. concerning the prices of wine and their import speaks of
‘Cochoures Engleys’ (English couchers, or lurkers), living in Rochelle,
Bordeaux, etc., who traded in wines. The tenor of the allusion to them,
however, is such that we could hardly expect them to be represented
openly in an English pageant.</p>

survey of its programme shows it evidently did, every trade or occupation
that could claim the slightest right to attention, we do not find it
having a place. The ‘Spicers’ and ‘Sauce-makers’ are prominent,
however, and they, no doubt, even then were upholding the interests of

<p class='c015'>The first list refers to the ‘saddlers, skinners, whitetawyers, shoemakers,
taylors, wrights, carpenters, masons, tylers, boatwrights, and
carters;’ the second to the ‘butchers, fishmongers, taverners,
brewers, bakers, and poulterers.’ With regard to the ‘Carnifex’ we
may add that among other items of expenditure belonging to Edw. I.’s
Queen at Cawood is mentioned ‘expensa duorum carnificum eosdem

<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r382'>382</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That this is the real origin of this name may be proved by 1
James I. c. xxiii., which is entitled an ‘Acte for the better preservation
of Fishinge in the Counties of Somersett, Devon, and Cornwall,
and for the relief of Balkers, Conders, and Fishermen against malicious
suites.’ In it too is found the following: ‘And whereas also for the

mashel, <i>i.e.</i>, the rudder used for mixing the malt. (v. <i>Maschel
Pr. Par.</i>)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c035' id='f386'>
<p class='c015'><span class='label'><a href='#r386'>386</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another proof of this is contained in the fact that in all allusions
in our olden ordinances to false dealings in the brewing and sale of ale
the punishment affixed is that of the <i>tumbrel</i>, the instrument for women,
corresponding to the <i>pillory</i> for men. I would not be mistaken. I
cannot doubt but that malster, tapster, baxter, webster, and kempster
were feminine occupations, and arose first in these forms as such. But
in the xivth century the distinction between ‘er’ and ‘ster’ was
dropped through the Norman-French ‘ess’ becoming the popular
termination. As ‘ess’ became still more strongly imbedded in the
language, ‘ster’ came into but more irregular use, and by the time
of Elizabeth men spoke of ‘drugster,’ ‘teamster,’ ‘rhymster,’
‘whipster,’ ‘trickster,’ ‘gamester.’ (<i>English Accidence</i>, p. 90.)
That this confusion was marked even in the earlier part of the xivth
century, not to say the close of the xiiith, is clearly proved by such
registered names as ‘Thatcher’ and ‘Thaxter,’ ‘Palliser’ and
‘Pallister,’ ‘Hewer’ and ‘Hewster,’ ‘Begger’ and ‘Beggister,’
‘Blacker’ (bleacher) and ‘Blaxter,’ ‘Dyer’ and ‘Dyster,’
‘Whiter’ and ‘Whitster,’ ‘Corviser’ and ‘Corvester,’ and
‘Bullinger,’ or ‘Billinger,’ and ‘Billingster.’ An old statute of
Ed. III. (<i>Statute Realm</i>, 1, 380) mentions ‘filesters,’ ‘throwsters,’
and ‘brawdesters;’ and Dr. Morris quotes ‘bellringster,’ ‘hoardster,’
and ‘washster.’ These latter are xiith and xiiith century words, and
were strictly confined to women.</p>

and farthings to be melted for vessels or other things, on pain of forfeiting
the money so melted and the imprisonment of the founder—‘surpeine
de forfaitre del monoie founder et imprisonement del foundour.’
(<i>Stat. Realm.</i>) The ‘founder,’ as his name implies, melted down the
metal, and then poured it (fundere) into the mould. We still speak
familiarly of a foundry; but the term ‘founder’ as a worker therein
is now, I believe, obsolete. Such names, however, as ‘Robert le
Fundour’ or ‘John le Funder,’ whose descendants are still with us,
show that this was once in common use. As an additional proof that
they were formerly more distinctively engaged in the manufacture of
pots and vessels, we may state that in the York Pageant, elsewhere
spoken of, the ‘Pewterers’ and ‘Founders’ marched together. Speaking
of ‘Founder,’ we are reminded of ‘Alefounder.’ In 1374 William
Alefounder was Rector of Bichamwell. (<i>Hist. Norf.</i>, vii. 295.) The
alefounder took his name from his duty as an inspector, appointed by
the Court Leet, of assizing and supervising the brewing of malt liquor.
He examined it as it was <i>poured</i> out. Thus ‘fundere,’ and not ‘fundare,’
is its root. Another name he bore was that of ‘ale-conner.’ A
poem of James the First’s reign says—</p>

(sedge). An old list of words which he also quotes has ‘a lepe maker,
cophinarius.’ (<i>Cath. Ang.</i>) I mention this latter especially, as I
have not been able so far to light upon any instance of the sobriquet.
I have no hesitation in saying, however, that if ‘Leaper’ and ‘Leapman’
be not manufacturers, they have, at any rate, as fish-sellers, originated
from the same root. ‘And thei eeten and weren fulfilled, and
thei taken up that that lefte of relifs sevene leepis.’ (Matt. viii. 8.

Thus the <i>Promptorium Parvulorum</i> gives as a familiar Norfolk term

(Latin, ‘crassus’). Turning to our registers, we find that while our
‘Crass’s’ are found in our more general rolls as ‘Richard le Cras’ or
‘John le Cras’ or ‘Stephen Crassus,’ our ‘Crasks’ must go to a

early, however, the term was applied to the vulgar <i>herd</i> of human kind,
but with far less opprobious meaning than now. Hall, quoting Henry
of Northumberland, speaks of Henry IV. as having obtained his crown
‘by the counsaill of thy frendes, and by open noising of the rascale
people’ (f. xxi.), <i>i.e.</i> the rabble. An extract from the Ordinances of
Henry VIII. at Eltham says, ‘It is ordained that none of the sergeants
at arms, heralds ... have, retain, or bring into the court any boyes or
rascalles, nor also other of their servants.’ The surname was very
common, and lasted a long time—‘John Raskele’ (H.), ‘Henry Rascall’
(Z.). Robert Rascal was persecuted for his religion in 1517 (Foxe).

causing the increase of a forename, unintended, we may feel sure, by
those most immediately concerned. A child was taken to church to
be baptized. The clergyman at the usual place turned to the mother
and asked what name the infant was to bear. ‘Robert,’ was the reply.
‘Any other name?’ he inquired. ‘Robert honly,’ she answered,
her grammar not being of the best description. ‘Robert Honly, I
baptize thee, in the name,’ etc., at once continued the clergyman, and

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
